<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Rubio is reportedly talking with Raúl Castro's grandson, says a U.S. media outlet  <br/>elTOQUE  <br/>February 18, 2026  <br/>Use less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/>Photo: AP/Cliff Owen, Archive  <br/>Photo: AP/Cliff Owen, Archive  <br/>Rubio is reportedly talking with Raúl Castro's grandson, says a U.S. media outlet  <br/>elTOQUE  <br/>February 18, 2026  <br/>Use less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is said to have held secret talks with  <br/>Raúl Guillermo Rodríguez Castro,  <br/>grandson and caretaker of Raúl Castro, according to three sources revealed to  <br/>Axios,  <br/>a reputable U.S. publication.  <br/>The talks, according to these sources, are taking place outside official channels of the Cuban Government, suggesting that the Donald Trump Administration considers that the real decision-making center remains in the hands of the elderly historic leader, now 94 years old.  <br/>“I wouldn't call this 'negotiations,' but rather 'discussions' about the future,” a senior Trump Administration official told  <br/>Axios.  <br/>The United States would be betting on informal interlocutors within the Castro family circle, bypassing the Communist Party’s designated president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, and other visible government figures.  <br/>According to cited sources, Washington views Díaz-Canel and the current leaders as mere bureaucrats of the communist apparatus, incapable of imagining or negotiating real change on the Island.  <br/>Rubio and his team see the former ruler’s grandson—41 years old—as part of a group of young Cubans with a business mindset for whom revolutionary communism has failed and who might consider some form of rapprochement with the United States.  <br/>“Our position—the U.S. Government’s position—is that the regime must fall,” said the senior official. “But exactly what that looks like depends on President Trump, and he has not yet made a decision. Rubio keeps talking with the grandson.”  <br/>Private jets, purchases, and links with businessmen: Raúl Castro’s grandson’s secret trips to Panama  <br/>A recent investigation revealed details about Raúl Guillermo Rodríguez Castro’s trips to Panama, holding the rank of colonel and former head of his grandfather Raúl Castro’s security detail; his connections with influential figures in the region, substantial purchases in the country, and also highlights the known ties between the Havana and Caracas regimes.  <br/>In political circles, Rodríguez Castro is known as “Raulito” and also as “El Cangrejo” (The Crab), a nickname, according to  <br/>Axios,  <br/>due to a deformity in one of his fingers. Raúl Guillermo is the son of Débora Castro Espín and the late General  <br/>Luis Alberto Rodríguez López-Callejas,  <br/>long in charge of the Armed Forces’ business system,  <br/>Gaesa.  <br/>After 67 years of U.S. sanctions and decades of internal economic mismanagement, the Cuban regime seems closer than ever to a terminal crisis, as the island has been sliding for months toward a humanitarian emergency.  <br/>The energy infrastructure is collapsing. Hospitals limit surgeries. Food and fuel are scarce. Tourism is plummeting. In several cities, garbage accumulates in the streets.  <br/>According to U.S. sources cited by  <br/>Axios,  <br/>the military operation against Maduro deeply shook the Cuban leadership due to the level of effectiveness and technical superiority demonstrated by the United States.  <br/>During that operation,  <br/>at least 32 Cuban intelligence and military officers died,  <br/>supposedly responsible for protecting Maduro.  <br/>However, Washington’s decision to keep chavismo allies in power—including Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, now acting president—has been interpreted by actors within the Cuban system as a sign that Trump and Rubio might be willing to negotiate agreements with sectors of the adversary.  <br/>“They are looking for the next Delcy in Cuba,” said a source familiar with the talks.  <br/>Axios  <br/>states that Trump advisors have spoken with other influential Cubans, but consider Rodríguez Castro the most important contact to cultivate.  <br/>“He is his grandfather’s favorite,” said one source, who also asserted that “Raulito” was Raúl Castro’s bodyguard and maintains alliances with Gaesa, one of the country’s largest centers of economic power.  <br/>According to the same source, talks between Rubio and Rodríguez Castro have been “surprisingly” friendly. “There are no political diatribes about the past. The conversation is about the future,” he explained.  <br/>Cuba: The End Has Begun  <br/>Efforts must now focus not on premature celebrations, but on all Cubans, inside and outside the island, thinking about how to act and plan in the face of an imminent collapse becoming inevitable due to the absolute lack of will by parasitic Cuban elites to lead the country towards a process of destotalitarianization.  <br/>The source noted that both share Cuban roots and an accent similar to Miami and nearby cities. “Raulito could come straight from Hialeah,” he said. “It could be a conversation between normal guys on the streets of Miami.”  <br/>Analysts cited by  <br/>Axios  <br/>believe Trump could opt for an approach similar to that applied in Venezuela: allowing certain system actors to remain in power and avoiding a complete purge of the state apparatus.  <br/>The precedent, they say, is the traumatic experience of “de-Baathification” in Iraq after the 2003 invasion, when the total dismantling of the political system generated chaos and institutional vacuum. That would imply that some members of the Castro family—including Raúl—might not be forced into exile under a potential agreement.  <br/>Asked about the contacts, the Cuban Government sent  <br/>Axios  <br/>a statement previously addressed to a Mexican journalist, denying high-level negotiations with the United States.  <br/>“There is no high-level dialogue between the U.S. Government and Cuba. There is not even dialogue at an intermediate level. There have been exchanges of messages,” the statement said. “What exists are the usual conversations that have occurred over a long period—or even less than that. Until a year ago, we had regular dialogues at the level of senior officials with the State Department. Today that no longer exists.”  <br/>Meanwhile, the State Department did not deny that Rubio has spoken with “Raulito” Castro, but a spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.  <br/>Trump Has Not Yet Decided What to Do About Cuba  <br/>According to  <br/>Axios,  <br/>Trump has still not defined a concrete plan toward Cuba. As happened in Venezuela, the president commissions trusted advisors—like Rubio—to present him with options.  <br/>However, the Cuban issue does not seem to be among his immediate priorities, overshadowed by conflicts such as wars in Iran and Ukraine.  <br/>“Cuba right now is a failed nation, and they don’t even have aviation fuel for planes to take off,” Trump said Monday night to journalists aboard  <br/>Air Force One.  <br/>“We are talking with Cuba right now... and they absolutely should make a deal.”</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Rubio estaría conversando con el nieto de Raúl Castro, asegura un medio estadounidense<br/>elTOQUE<br/>febrero 18, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>Foto: AP/Cliff Owen, Archivo<br/>Foto: AP/Cliff Owen, Archivo<br/>Rubio estaría conversando con el nieto de Raúl Castro, asegura un medio estadounidense<br/>elTOQUE<br/>febrero 18, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>El secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Marco Rubio, habría sostenido conversaciones secretas con<br/>Raúl Guillermo Rodríguez Castro<br/>, nieto y cuidador de Raúl Castro, según reve...</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>"In Cuba there is freedom of expression": the FALSE claims of the Cuban ambassador in the Dominican Republic  <br/>Marleidy Muñoz  <br/>February 18, 2026  <br/><br/>The Cuban ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Ángel Arzuaga Reyes, stated on February 10, 2026, on the program El Día, on Telesistema 11, that on the island "no one is imprisoned for their thoughts. In Cuba, only those who commit proven crimes are imprisoned, following due process. But no one for their thoughts or beliefs." "I don’t know why it is said that there is no freedom of expression in Cuba. Cubans express opinions about everything, on any corner, inside or outside the country," he added. The diplomat's statements are FALSE.  <br/><br/>Documented evidence by human rights organizations, as well as the legal framework and state practice on the island, contradict Arzuaga Reyes’s claim. In Cuba, there are people imprisoned for political reasons, criminal charges are used against protesters and critics, there is no legal recognition for independent press, and cases of exile, bans on entering the country, and judicial procedures against activists, independent journalists, and content creators have been reported.  <br/><br/>Prison for expressing an opinion: cases disproving the ambassador  <br/>Ángel Arzuaga Reyes’s assertions came after he was directly questioned about the arbitrary detention on February 6, 2026, of young creators of the El4tico project, a case illustrating punishment against those exercising freedom of expression on the island.  <br/><br/>Ernesto Ricardo Medina and Kamil Zayas Pérez remain imprisoned in Holguín, accused of the crime of "propaganda against the constitutional order." Both used digital platforms to express criticism of the Government and comment on the national reality amid the deep widespread crisis the country is facing.  <br/><br/>Following the massive protests on July 11, 2021 (11J), over 1,000 people were detained and hundreds sentenced, according to underreported figures by human rights organizations. Sentences were also handed down against participants in later mobilizations. However, detentions and imprisonments are not limited to that context: many people have been prosecuted for political reasons or for exercising rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, and association.  <br/><br/>Luis Robles was imprisoned after peacefully protesting with a sign; artists like Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara and rapper Maykel Osorbo were sentenced in 2022; and opposition leaders like José Daniel Ferrer have been prosecuted and imprisoned after expressing criticism of the Government.  <br/><br/>She sent a message to Trump and was caught by the political Police. What is Ankeilys Guerra accused of in Cuba?  <br/>"We Cubans, besides being dead in life, are also dead in spirit. How much hope I have that the time for freedom will come!" said Ankeilys Guerra in one of her live broadcasts, days before State Security raided her home.  <br/><br/>International reports — such as Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net — also document cases where several people faced prison sentences for posting critical content online. For example, Mayelín Rodríguez Prado was sentenced to 15 years in prison after uploading a video to Facebook of a protest showing police violence; and Yennis Artola del Sol’s eight-year sentence "is based solely on having taken a photo of a poster with the phrase ‘Homeland and Life,’ considered by the regime as an act of political opposition," denounced the Cuban Observatory of Human Rights (OCDH).  <br/><br/>Lázaro Manuel Hernández Pérez, 33, a baker in Ranchuelo (Villa Clara), has been held in provisional detention since September 2025, accused of "propaganda against the constitutional order" and "contempt" for alleged Facebook posts. The Prosecutor’s Office is demanding six years in prison against the entrepreneur.  <br/><br/>The 56-year-old from Santiago, Julio César Duque de Estrada Ferrer, was also sentenced to four years and six months in prison for "disobedience" and "assault" after recording on his cellphone a queue to buy gas in September 2024. Activist Alexander Verdecia Rodríguez faces a ten-year prison request after posting critical messages against the Government on Facebook, such as "no more blackouts" and "down with Díaz-Canel." William Sosa, a Facebook user known for his analyses of the economic crisis in Cuba, was detained on November 12, 2025, in Las Tunas for alleged "disobedience."  <br/><br/>Other citizens have faced similar proceedings for posts on social media, recording situations of shortages, or expressing critical slogans.  <br/><br/>Punishments for thinking differently: censorship, exile, and forced exile  <br/>The legal framework in Cuba also imposes formal limits on the press. The 2019 Constitution establishes that the main social communication media are socialist property and cannot be privately owned. In practice, this prevents the legalization of independent media and leaves non-state journalists in a situation of permanent vulnerability.  <br/><br/>Reporters from independent media have been detained, summoned by State Security, fined, and subjected to de facto house arrest. Some have faced criminal proceedings; others have chosen exile after pressure or conditional releases tied to leaving the country. Bans on leaving or entering Cuba have also been documented against activists and critical communicators, such as former university professor Omara Ruiz Urquiola, journalists Carlos Manuel Álvarez and Karla Pérez, art historian Anamely Ramos, and the opposition member of the Ladies in White, Leticia Ramos Herrería, who was prevented from entering Cuba on February 9, 2026.  <br/><br/>The exile of Cuban Glenda Corella: another line of impunity for the tiger  <br/>Cuban Glenda Corella Céspedes traveled from Canada to Cuba on March 7, 2023. Upon arrival, authorities prevented her from entering the country without explanation.  <br/><br/>"In 2025, the Cuban Observatory of Human Rights documented more than 3,100 repressive actions, including arbitrary detentions, harassment, and fines for posts on social media and peaceful protests. It is also estimated that at least 800 people remain in prison for political and conscience reasons," Yaxys Cires, communication director of the NGO, told elTOQUE.  <br/><br/>Cires explains that the Cuban official’s statements are "false compared to the available evidence about political prisoners, rigged trials, and repression of freedom of expression in Cuba." "The complaints of Cuban human rights organizations have been supported by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Inter American Press Association, the European Parliament, and the Inter American Commission on Human Rights," he specifies.  <br/><br/>The "due process" that is not fulfilled  <br/>The Cuban Penal Code maintains broad figures such as "contempt," "incitement to crime," and "propaganda against the constitutional order" that have been used against activists, journalists, and critical citizens. International organizations have pointed out that these criminal categories are incompatible with international standards of freedom of expression.  <br/><br/>Various international bodies have also noted that judicial processes stemming from the July 11 protests or other public demonstrations on the island, as well as those related to freedom of expression, have been marked by restrictions on access to effective defense, collective trials, prohibitions on entry to courts, and questions about the proportionality of sentences. The Inter American Commission on Human Rights has warned about the use of criminal law to punish peaceful protest in Cuba and has expressed concern over the lack of judicial guarantees.  <br/><br/>Given this panorama — documented political prisoners, use of criminal charges against dissent, inexistence of legally recognized independent press, and criminalization of critical voices — it is unsupportable to affirm that in Cuba "no one goes to prison for their thoughts" or that "everything is openly discussed" without consequences.  <br/><br/>If you need us to verify content for you, you can contact us through any of these channels:  <br/>Email: [email protected]  <br/>WhatsApp and Signal: +1 786 403-8554  <br/>Form  <br/>Telegram</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>«En Cuba hay libertad de expresión»: las afirmaciones FALSAS del embajador cubano en República Dominicana<br/>Marleidy Muñoz<br/>febrero 18, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>«En Cuba hay libertad de expresión»: las afirmaciones FALSAS del embajador cubano en República Dominicana<br/>Marleidy Muñoz<br/>febrero 18, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>El embajador de Cuba en República Dominicana, Ángel Arzuaga Reyes,<br/>afirmó<br/>el 10 de febrero de 2026 en el programa<br/>El Día<br/>, de Telesistema 11, que en la isla «a nadie se mete preso por ...</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>"The Pride of the Family": Who Is the Professor Convicted in Cuba for Painting Signs Against Díaz-Canel  <br/>Raúl Medina Orama  <br/>February 17, 2026  <br/>Use less data by receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>Photo: Facebook of the Academic Freedom Observatory.  <br/><br/>Ariel Manuel Martín Barroso has not set foot on a university campus for almost a year, although he has more than enough credentials to lead a classroom. The professor at the Faculty of Technical and Business Sciences of the University of Sancti Spíritus "José Martí Pérez" (Uniss) was sentenced in September 2025 to a combined penalty of ten years in prison for painting phrases against the Havana regime; some were directed at the leader Miguel Díaz-Canel. However, since February 25, 2025, he had already been enduring the harshness of political imprisonment, which allegedly caused him severe depression, according to family sources consulted by  <br/>elTOQUE.  <br/><br/>"He is a very noble person, he has never been 'streetwise.' We didn’t dare to disclose this for fear that they would take further reprisals against him in prison, but the abuse has become too much, so we decided to publicize his case," his cousin Jorge Luis González, who lives in the United States, explained to this outlet.  <br/><br/>According to sentence number 11 of 2025 from the Villa Clara Provincial People’s Court, which  <br/>elTOQUE  <br/>had access to, the charges used to convict Martín Barroso were "propaganda against the constitutional order" and "disrespect," in a process where he was accused of writing antigovernmental signs on the walls of the university in Sancti Spíritus and other places in the city, at various times between 2024 and early 2025.  <br/><br/>The Academic Freedom Observatory (OLA) — the organization that  <br/>reported first  <br/>about the case — describes the political prisoner as a "researcher and professor with institutional prestige and among the student body," deserving of recognition as the "author of the best doctoral thesis" of 2023, at the Faculty of Accounting and Finance of the University of Havana (UH).  <br/><br/>On January 15, 2024, Uniss congratulated Ariel Manuel Martín Barroso (among other professors) on the official Facebook page of the higher education center for obtaining the doctoral degree in Sciences. Ariel Manuel Martín was also a member of the National Accreditation Board (JAN) of the Ministry of Higher Education (MES).  <br/><br/>According to the Academic Freedom Observatory, the professor "was subject to monitoring by State Security agents who surveilled the Uniss campus, who testified against him"; he was prejudged by being labeled a habitual "suspect" "due to his conduct against the revolutionary process."  <br/><br/>In the sentence held by  <br/>elTOQUE,  <br/>the witnesses for the prosecution are identified as State Security officer Arianna Rojas Díaz and Ministry of the Interior (Minint) officer Dania Iris Rodríguez Rodríguez, agents "assigned to the University."  <br/><br/>To convict the political prisoner, the members of the Villa Clara court — Grisel Santos Suárez, Noralmis Blanco Echarte, and Ricardo Hernández Domínguez — also considered testimonies from the Uniss rector, Edelvy Bravo Amarante, and the provincial Transportation delegate in Sancti Spíritus, José Lorenzo García.  <br/><br/>Ileana Curra Lussón, a political exile who  <br/>published  <br/>part of the sentence, has reported that the university professor is held in the maximum-security prison "Nieves Morejón" (Sancti Spíritus), a "prison with countless  <br/>complaints about the inhumane and unsanitary conditions suffered there, as well as mistreatment of prisoners."  <br/><br/>Ariel Manuel Martín was "incommunicado for five or six months" after his arrest in February 2025, Jorge Luis González told  <br/>elTOQUE.  <br/><br/>The family member assures that, during some visits received at the prison, Martín Barroso has appeared "very depressed, but Ariel is not a person who talks much and expresses what he is going through inside."  <br/><br/>Excerpt from the sentence against Ariel Manuel Martín Barroso.  <br/><br/>According to González, his cousin had no public political statements for most of his life. However, "he is a fanatic of the works of José Martí, and we used to speak about that, which gradually changed his thinking" about the country’s situation.  <br/><br/>One event is identified by the family member as the trigger for the university professor’s politicization, at least in a private setting. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ariel’s mother died of cancer at home without receiving adequate medical care, according to González.  <br/><br/>"That was his limit. During one of the last conversations we had, he told me: 'Cousin, I am already 40 years old, what am I in my life, with so many degrees and studies? What am I in this country? Nobody,'" the family member recounts.  <br/><br/>The case of the academic from Sancti Spíritus is not unique in Cuba. A  <br/>special report  <br/>from the Academic Freedom Observatory, published in December 2025, documented at least 18 cases of Cuban professors and students "victims of the Government of Cuba’s repression against the July 11 protests," the social upheaval of July 2021.  <br/><br/>After those massive protests across the country, persecution of regime dissenters has not lessened. Human rights organizations record between  <br/>753  <br/>and  <br/>1,207  <br/>people imprisoned for demonstrating in public spaces, affiliating with dissident groups, or  <br/>expressing opinions on social media.  <br/><br/>Cuban economist Mauricio de Miranda Parrondo, professor at Javeriana University of Cali (Colombia), described Ariel Manuel Martín’s trial as a "vulgar injustice" that "only occurs in dictatorial regimes."  <br/><br/>De Miranda Parrondo  <br/>added on Facebook: "While the country sinks into the most terrible misery, amid the incompetence and neglect of those clinging desperately to power; and the external pressures hitting a society that can no longer endure; it seems the only available resources [of the State] are allocated to the cruelest repression."  <br/><br/>"They deserve their freedom no matter the name": new initiatives demand amnesty for political prisoners in Cuba  <br/>On February 4, 2026, after one of the coldest early mornings remembered in Cuba in a long time, three women went to an office of the National Assembly where they submitted a petition requesting the approval of an amnesty law for hundreds of political prisoners.  <br/><br/>In reality, the "crime" the authorities do not forgive him is being consistent with the writings of José Martí, one of his intellectual heroes: "Freedom is the right every man has to be honest, and to think and to speak without hypocrisy. (...) A man who obeys a bad government without working to make the government good is not an honest man."  <br/><br/>The OLA has called on the international academic community for "solidarity, accompaniment, and amplification of such a grave human rights violation."  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, people close to Ariel Manuel Martín Barroso hope that breaking the silence about his case will help the university professor obtain justice. "He is a brainy kid, the pride of the family," concluded his cousin Jorge Luis González.  <br/><br/>***  <br/>From elTOQUE we have sent requests for comments to the Ministry of Higher Education and the University of Sancti Spíritus regarding the situation of Professor Martín Barroso and the OLA statement, but as of the time of publishing this note, we have not received a response.  <br/><br/>If you are interested in legal topics, you can visit our projects  <br/>elTOQUE Jurídico  <br/>and  <br/>Legalis,  <br/>where you will find analysis and debates about laws, rights, and legal proceedings in Cuba.  <br/><br/>Follow us also on Twitter:  <br/>@eltoquejuridico</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>«El orgullo de la familia»: quién es el profesor condenado en Cuba por pintar letreros contra Díaz-Canel<br/>Raúl Medina Orama<br/>febrero 17, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>Foto: Facebook del Observatorio de Libertad Académica.<br/>Foto: Facebook del Observatorio de Libertad Académica.<br/>«El orgullo de la familia»: quién es el profesor condenado en Cuba por pintar letreros contra Díaz-Canel<br/>Raúl Medina Orama<br/>febrero 17, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>Ariel Manuel Martín Barroso no pisa un campus universitario desde hace...</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Is the Cuban Government Losing Its Historical Allies?<br/>Yenys Laura Prieto<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>Use less data receiving our content on<br/>WhatsApp<br/>or<br/>Telegram<br/><br/>Is the Cuban Government Losing Its Historical Allies?<br/>Yenys Laura Prieto<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>Use less data receiving our content on<br/>WhatsApp<br/>or<br/>Telegram<br/><br/>The diplomatic scene surrounding Cuba today is not marked by formal ruptures but by nuances. The public statements of the Cuban regime's historical allies maintain a friendly tone, but when the facts — volumes, deadlines, specific commitments — are reviewed, external support appears measured. Cordiality is maintained on a symbolic level, but in practice, support is managed with caution that reveals new priorities.<br/><br/>On February 12, the Russian newspaper Izvestia reported, after consulting alleged diplomatic sources, that Russia would send oil and derivatives to Cuba as "humanitarian aid" to alleviate the energy crisis. That same day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke of contacts and willingness to consider assistance for the island, but did not confirm new fuel shipments or structural financial agreements.<br/><br/>The difference between "evaluating support" and announcing concrete supplies is significant in a country where power outages have become part of the daily routine. "We would not want any escalation, but, on the other hand, as of today we (Russia and the U.S.) have almost no commercial exchange," Peskov commented in his daily press briefing. On the other hand, diplomatic sources advised their nationals not to travel to the Caribbean country.<br/><br/>What might be behind these decisions?<br/><br/>According to a Bloomberg report, citing an alleged Kremlin internal memorandum drafted this year, Russia is considering the possibility of returning to operate within the dollar payment system as part of a potential economic understanding with the United States. The document would describe seven areas where Moscow believes interests could converge with Washington after a possible agreement to end the war in Ukraine. These include cooperation in fossil fuels, joint investments in offshore natural gas and oil, and benefits for U.S. companies. The outlet notes that the proposal circulated among senior Russian officials in the context of broader negotiations.<br/><br/>In January 2026, the Chinese government announced the shipment of 60,000 tons of rice and an emergency financial aid of 80 million dollars. This is a tangible contribution but limited in scale compared to the magnitude of the energy and production shortages facing the Cuban economy, indicates a note from the EFE news agency.<br/><br/>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed his rejection of what he called external interference in Cuba during a meeting with his counterpart, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, held on February 5. In the meeting, the Chinese diplomat assured that his country would continue providing support and assistance "within its capabilities." However, the statements did not include concrete details about the scope, amounts, or specific nature of the announced support. Nor were new economic or financial agreements derived from the visit specified.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is Beijing’s displeasure over the slow pace of economic reforms on the island, the publication indicates. Joe Mazur, analyst at the consultancy Trivium China, told the agency: "China is interested in maintaining and protecting its relationships with various Latin American countries, but it has to walk a very fine line in this case." According to diplomatic sources, the lack of signals for economic openness has limited its willingness to grant significant loans or undertake large-scale investments, as it has done in other countries in the region.<br/><br/>Mexico also made clear the conditional nature of its support. President Claudia Sheinbaum recently expressed willingness to facilitate a humanitarian air bridge if there is a formal request from the Cuban regime and confirmed food shipments. However, the possible supply of oil remains under evaluation. This is not a rejection but a limited cooperation subject to explicit bilateral procedures.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Minister of Public Health José Ángel Portal Miranda acknowledged that the shortage of medical supplies will not be resolved in the short term. A reduction in elective surgeries and a reorganization of hospital services are foreseen. Authorities have reiterated that care for foreign visitors is guaranteed, a statement that has generated questions on social networks where images of hospitals with material limitations and power supply problems circulate.<br/><br/>In parallel, criminal proceedings have been opened against content creators linked to critical digital projects, and reactions from international organizations to these measures have been reported.

Photo: AP/Reference image.  <br/>Migrants in Brazil. Photo: AP/Reference image.  <br/><br/>No, Cubans do not apply for residency through humanitarian shelter in Brazil  <br/>Marleidy Muñoz  <br/>February 17, 2026  <br/><br/>Spend less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>On social media, posts have been circulating claiming that Cubans can apply for residency in Brazil through the figure of "humanitarian shelter." However, this claim is FALSE.  <br/><br/>There is currently no program or regulatory act that allows Cubans to apply for residency in the South American country under this figure.  <br/><br/>According to Brazil’s  <br/>Migration Law  <br/>(Law 13,445/2017), Article 14, § 3, "the temporary visa for humanitarian shelter may be granted to a stateless person or a national of any country in a situation of":  <br/>- severe or imminent institutional instability,  <br/>- armed conflict,  <br/>- large-scale calamity,  <br/>- environmental disaster,  <br/>- serious violation of human rights or international humanitarian law.  <br/><br/>The Cuban researcher Alexei Padilla Herrera, residing in Brazil, points out that so far there is no joint act of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security nor the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that officially recognizes Cuba’s situation for humanitarian shelter purposes.  <br/><br/>Padilla Herrera, a professor working as a migration consultant at Diáspora Consultoría, clarifies that this means there is no specific humanitarian shelter program for Cuban nationals nor administrative rules (resolutions or ordinances) applicable to migrants from the island. He also notes that the Brazilian Consulate in Havana is not authorized to process this type of visa for Cubans.  <br/><br/>Therefore, Cuban citizens seeking protection in Brazil must primarily resort to asylum applications.  <br/><br/>Asylum for Cubans in Brazil: thousands of applications and minimal approvals in 2025  <br/><br/>In 2025, Brazil’s Ministry of Justice granted only two asylum applications to Cuban citizens, despite 41,919 nationals from the island applying for that status. The figure represented 55.4% of the total 75,599 applications registered in the country and was an increase of more than 88% compared to 2024, when 22,288 applications from Cubans were counted.  <br/><br/>The contrast is remarkable when compared with the 8,946 asylum grants in 2024—with 218 denials, 12 of which corresponded to Cubans—and with previous years: in 2021, 332 Cuban applications were approved and in 2022, 406. Between 2023 and 2025, however, only six migrants from the island received a favorable response.  <br/><br/>According to  <br/>data  <br/>from the International Migration Observatory (OBMigra), about 40% of Cubans who applied for asylum in 2025 were between 15 and 24 years old, reflecting a markedly young flow. In addition, 36,667 applications were filed in the state of Roraima, bordering Venezuela; and 8,376 in Amapá, bordering French Guiana—main land entry points used by migrants arriving after traveling through neighboring countries.  <br/><br/>The figures also show steady growth in recent years: in 2023, 12,101 Cuban applications were registered; in 2022, 5,965; and in 2021, 524. These numbers do not include those who remain in Brazil without regularizing their migration status.  <br/><br/>What changed in 2026?  <br/><br/>Since January 1, 2026, Brazil adopted a unified visa and residency regime for humanitarian shelter. Previously, differentiated mechanisms benefited nationals of certain crisis countries; under the new scheme, there is no longer automatic eligibility by nationality.  <br/><br/>Now, the Brazilian Government must define through official acts which situations and nationalities may access this type of visa. Also, a letter of shelter issued by an organization in Brazil is required. Those who obtain the visa can apply for temporary residency for two years with the right to work, and later opt for permanent residency if they meet legal requirements.  <br/><br/>Previously, there were specific programs for certain nationalities like Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, and Ukraine. Currently, there is no automatic list of eligible countries.  <br/><br/>Granting depends on:  <br/>- Joint act of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  <br/>- Formal recognition of the humanitarian situation.  <br/>- Definition of specific requirements in administrative rules.  <br/>- Letter of shelter issued by an associated NGO (for applications abroad).  <br/>- Submission of the application at an authorized Brazilian consulate.  <br/><br/>The visa grants temporary residency for two years with the right to work. It can be renewed and later converted into indefinite residency according to current regulations.  <br/><br/>If you need us to verify content for you, you can contact us through any of these means:  <br/>Email: [email protected]  <br/>WhatsApp and Signal: +1 786 403-8554  <br/>Form  <br/>Telegram</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>No, los cubanos no aplican a residencia por acogida humanitaria en Brasil<br/>Marleidy Muñoz<br/>febrero 17, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>Migrantes en Brasil.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Exclusive: Noslen Díaz confirms his departure and explains why he is leaving Cuban volleyball  <br/>Mayli Estévez  <br/>February 16, 2026  <br/><br/>Use less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>Photo: Facebook of Noslen Díaz  <br/><br/>Exclusive: Noslen Díaz confirms his departure and explains why he is leaving Cuban volleyball  <br/>Mayli Estévez  <br/>February 16, 2026  <br/><br/>Use less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>Noslen Díaz's story with Cuban beach volleyball took a turn that just a month ago seemed unlikely.  <br/><br/>If, in early January 2026, the athlete clarified to elTOQUE that he had not requested to leave the Cuban Volleyball Federation and wished to continue wearing the national jersey, today the outlook is different.  <br/><br/>The Artemisa native confirmed in exclusive statements that his departure is a fact and that he will not continue within the federation structure.  <br/><br/>On February 12, 2026, news spread through colleague Robert García that Díaz and his partner Jorge Luis Alayo had officially requested to leave the national team amid controversy over delayed prize payments corresponding to several international tournaments.  <br/><br/>At that time, institutional silence contrasted with media repercussions. Today, it is Noslen who clears up doubts.  <br/><br/>The decision was not impulsive. During January, he continued training while the future of the duo that led Cuba to historic results was being decided: ninth place at the 2025 World Championship in Australia—the best placement by a Cuban pair in that event—titles at the Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour in Quintana Roo, gold at the Russian Supercup, and multiple podium finishes on the international circuit.  <br/><br/>“Until everything was decided about how the men’s duo would be arranged, I was training. After learning what would be done, I left,” explained the player over two meters tall, one of the main references in Cuban beach volleyball in recent years.  <br/><br/>“I want to keep playing”: Noslen Díaz speaks after controversy over unpaid prizes  <br/><br/>The possible departure of Noslen Díaz and Jorge Luis Alayo from Cuban volleyball again puts unpaid prizes and the lack of financial support for high-performance athletes at the center of debate. Despite their international successes and their place among the best pairs in the world, delays in prize payments and the absence of institutional support threaten the continuation of a key project for Cuban beach volleyball.  <br/><br/>Alayo’s departure was decisive in his decision. At 23 years old and in full competitive maturity, Díaz chose not to continue without the Villaclara athlete by his side.  <br/><br/>“I didn't want to keep playing with a new partner. Now, what I want is for them to give me the release and to get married,” he added. His immediate priority seems to be off the court. “I’m waiting for the wedding with my girlfriend (the American volleyball player Kylie Deberg),” he commented, making it clear that he will use this period to focus on his personal life while deciding his next professional step.  <br/><br/>“I hope to be able to keep playing soon abroad,” he stated, although he did not confirm if he has any concrete offers.  <br/><br/>One of the most sensitive points in the Díaz and Alayo case has been the non-payment of prizes. According to previous reports, the owed amount reaches $107,000 USD, related to results at international events, including the December 2025 World Championship.  <br/><br/>In January, Díaz acknowledged to elTOQUE that “the money issue is true,” although he expressed confidence that his case would be resolved. A month later, the issue continues to generate speculation.  <br/><br/>Asked whether the payment was finally made, the player clarified to elTOQUE: “That takes a process, which we are not going to carry out right now with the Cuban Federation, but they are not to blame for the non-payment. That money remains deposited in the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) bank.”  <br/><br/>With this statement, he distanced direct responsibility from the Cuban Volleyball Federation and pointed to a more complex process linked to the FIVB’s payment mechanisms.  <br/><br/>According to official FIVB documents, they pay cash prizes directly to individual players via bank transfer, provided the players supply their complete banking information (IBAN, Swift, etc.) in their Volleyball Information System (VIS) profiles.  <br/><br/>Money yes, autonomy no: Cuban sport facing the era of advertising and sponsorship  <br/><br/>Although the discourse acknowledges that the State cannot sustain sports alone and opens the door to new income sources, the management of those resources remains centralized and unclear regarding the real autonomy of beneficiaries.  <br/><br/>In the case of Cuban athletes (possibly due to Inder regulations or lack of personal banking data from the player), the money might be deposited in a bank account associated with or managed by the Cuban Federation, but the FIVB does not transfer it there unless the player specifies it. Nevertheless, the Cuban entity is responsible for timely distribution of the prize funds once accessible in their accounts.  <br/><br/>Díaz’s departure reopens the debate about the sustainability of high-performance sport in Cuba. This is not just any case: we are talking about a duo that managed to place among the top ten in the world ranking and restored international prominence to Cuban beach volleyball.  <br/><br/>The chemistry built over years between Díaz and Alayo was one of the country’s main sporting assets in this discipline. Replacing that mechanism will not be easy or immediate.  <br/><br/>For now, Noslen Díaz closes a chapter. His immediate future is on hold, but his talent remains intact. In the international circuit, a player of his caliber rarely stays long without offers.</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Exclusiva: Noslen Díaz confirma su baja y aclara por qué deja el voleibol cubano<br/>Mayli Estévez<br/>febrero 16, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>Foto: Facebook de Noslen Díaz<br/>Foto: Facebook de Noslen Díaz<br/>Exclusiva: Noslen Díaz confirma su baja y aclara por qué deja el voleibol cubano<br/>Mayli Estévez<br/>febrero 16, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>La historia de Noslen Díaz con el voleibol de playa cubano dio un giro que hace apenas un mes parecía poco probable.<br/>Si a inicios de enero de 2026, el atleta aclaraba a<br/>elTOQUE...</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Keys to Breaking the Eternity of the Cuban Autocracy  <br/>Raudiel Peña Barrios  <br/>February 16, 2026  <br/><br/>Use less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>Photo: elTOQUE.  <br/><br/>When the transitions to democracy occurred in the late 1980s and 1990s, several autocratic regimes did so peacefully. In some cases, their political elites accepted the negative results of participatory exercises they themselves convened. This suggests that the leaderships of some autocracies perceive themselves and the political regimes they lead as exceptional and temporary. The first refers to accepting that their existence is based on various conditions which, once they disappear, make the regime unnecessary and an unavoidable transition to democracy occurs. The second refers to their awareness that the regime’s tenure is limited in time.  <br/><br/>Some autocratic regimes legitimized themselves as temporary responses to certain threats; for example, the fight against communism during the Cold War. Repression and suspension of freedoms were presented as exceptional means to restore a threatened order. This difference in origin does not lessen or justify the human rights violations committed, but it does explain why those regimes accepted, when the time came, a negotiated exit from power.  <br/><br/>The Latin American military dictatorships legitimized themselves as responses to prior pressure for change, associated with the regional impact of the Cuban Revolution and the expansion of guerrilla movements. When stopping communism lost centrality, they accepted transitions to democracy. Their leaders recognized defeats in plebiscites convened by the powers — as happened in Chile and Uruguay — and accepted the end of their presence in power. Even the temporal nature of autocracy was normatively acknowledged. The 1980 Chilean Constitution was designed to organize a negotiated transition, with defined deadlines and mechanisms, so the governing elite perceived themselves as necessary for a limited time.  <br/><br/>In contrast, revolutionary autocracies tend to exhibit exceptional durability because they incorporate a historic mission that makes them irreplaceable. They do not see themselves as the solution to a crisis, but as the definitive crystallization of a political project. This was constitutionally confirmed in Cuba. The 1976 Constitution did not recognize any expiration horizon for power because the regime was never thought of as a historical parenthesis, which was confirmed by the inclusion of the 2002 clause of untouchability, which declared socialism irrevocable. The 2019 Constitution maintains that clause.  <br/><br/>What can Cubans do to be useful during a transition?  <br/>I suggest focusing, both on the island and in the diaspora, on supporting some very minimal social initiative or instance, but real and human, that has the liberation of prisoners as its first objective.  <br/><br/>Therefore, not all autocratic leaderships see themselves the same way. Some assume themselves as definitive orders. That difference in the governing elite’s self-perception is not a historical or theoretical detail, but a variable explaining how much they are willing to risk to stay in power, what costs they accept, and when — if at all — they consider negotiating a peaceful transition to democracy. The self-perception of immutable necessity and timelessness is not only related to the revolutionary origin of an autocracy. In Venezuela, both Chávez and Maduro explicitly stated that the opposition would not return to power through electoral means. This premise was not only discursive or symbolic but marked the political regime’s legal and institutional order.  <br/><br/>Since 1959, Fidel Castro and his followers perceived themselves as a historic project without an expiration date. They did not govern to prepare a transition to democracy but to embody exclusively the only possible legitimate political order. This self-perception explains why the Cuban regime has accepted levels of economic, social, and institutional deterioration that would be unthinkable for other autocracies.  <br/><br/>Autocratic elites who conceive of themselves as timeless and limitless do not assess political risks the same way as those who know their existence is based on the circumstances that caused their origin. Such elites can dispense with sources of legitimacy, such as economic performance, social inclusion, or limited political-electoral participation, without altering their survival strategy. The economy and public services may collapse; political participation may become irrelevant; international recognition may disappear, and isolation and sanctions may persist for decades. All are bearable. The only unacceptable thing is to lose control of power.  <br/><br/>In Cuba, failure ceased to be a political problem for the elite. The crisis is not an anomaly but a structural condition with which they have accepted to coexist as long as the current regime persists based on repression. Poverty is not a transitory cost but a permanent state and a repressive mechanism. Massive emigration is not an alarm but an escape valve for internal pressure on the regime. As far as the elite is concerned, none of the above forces a change of course as long as the costs of repression are lower than those of transitioning to democracy.  <br/><br/>Cuba: the end has begun  <br/>Efforts must now concentrate not on premature celebrations but on thinking about all Cubans, inside and outside the island, about how to act and plan for an imminent collapse that becomes inevitable due to the absolute lack of will among Cuban parasitic elites to lead the country toward a process of detotalitarization.  <br/><br/>The capacity to accept unlimited risks has an additional explanation: the existence of internal stability mechanisms that allow the regime to manage conflicts without fracturing. In this framework, the figure of Raúl Castro is fundamental because he performs an arbitration function within the regime. He has been the final instance of resolving inter-elite conflicts, the actor capable of containing disputes among civilian, military, and party factions, and the ultimate guarantor that disagreements do not escalate to jeopardize power cohesion.  <br/><br/>No relevant actor within the regime can ignore his word without incurring a high political cost. As long as this referee exists, the elite will tolerate external pressures, internal failures, and recurring crises without altering their self-perception of permanence. The certainty that there is always an instance capable of closing ranks reduces uncertainty and makes the notion of indefinite continuity credible. For this reason, Raúl Castro’s eventual death is not a symbolic event but a political fact. His disappearance does not imply the automatic collapse of the regime nor guarantee a democratic transition, but it does eliminate one of the main informal mechanisms of internal stability. Without a referee, inter-elite conflicts become more dangerous, succession disputes more uncertain, and the margin for error decreases.  <br/><br/>In this context, the self-perception of eternity could begin to crack, not because ideology changes or because the economy or social situation improves or worsens, but because continuity ceases to feel secure. The regime may preserve control of the coercive apparatus, but doubt arises: Who decides ultimately? Who guarantees conflicts will not lead to ruptures? Who assures that everyone will lose the same if the regime collapses?  <br/><br/>However, that internal crack is not enough. Raúl Castro’s death is only a window of opportunity. Timeless autocracies can recover fairly easily after the loss of their top leader. For the loss of the referee to decisively influence the elite’s self-perception, it is essential that external pressure on the regime is maintained or even increased; this raises the cost of remaining in power at a moment of uncertainty. Additionally, it reduces room for maneuver, limits individual exits, and makes the strategy of resisting indefinitely more costly.  <br/><br/>Cuba and the freedom to come  <br/>Cubans speak of freedom with a mixture of yearning, suspicion, nostalgia, and a good dose of fatigue. Freedom is, for us, a bright word and, at the same time, an unknown territory. It has been promised, sacrificed, invoked, and eternally postponed.  <br/><br/>When that pressure relaxes, the regime gains time to reorganize, close ranks, rebuild a narrative of continuity, and make institutional adjustments that expose an image of changes that do not actually occur. When pressure is sustained, internal tensions amplify, and it becomes more difficult to pretend nothing has changed. In Cuba’s case, this is crucial due to the political opposition’s weakness and civil society — whose leaders mostly are exiled or imprisoned — to apply effective internal pressure on the regime.  <br/><br/>Autocratic elites that see themselves and the political regime they built as eternal do not negotiate transitions because they become democratic. Nor because they recognize the social suffering generated by their management of power. They negotiate when staying becomes riskier than leaving in time. Transition starts in the psyche of those who govern before it begins at the negotiating table. In Cuba, that moment may come when two processes coincide: the loss of the main factor of internal cohesion and an international environment that does not provide free oxygen.  <br/><br/>Raúl Castro’s death may mark the beginning of that moment, but only if used wisely. Without sustained external pressure, the Cuban elite, no matter how weak their legitimacy, authority, management capacity, and mobilization (among other factors) are, can find new balances and govern as before, even under extreme poverty, dollarization of the economy, inability to provide basic public services, and minimal levels of political mobilization and participation. In contrast, with pressure and without a moderator referee of conflicts, the self-perception can change: the elite begins to see its regime as finite, vulnerable, and replaceable.  <br/><br/>Negotiated democratic transitions do not begin when timeless regimes fail but when belief in their invulnerability ends. In the Cuban case, the challenge is not to wait for a definitive collapse that can certainly happen at any time but which the regime so far avoids through repression. The opportunity for negotiated transition will be political, fragile, and dependent on real costs to the autocratic elite. Raising those costs does not guarantee change, but not doing so guarantees continuity. Even autocratic elites that believe themselves eternal ultimately depend on that belief persisting.  <br/><br/>ELTOQUE  <br/>IS A CREATIVE SPACE OPEN TO DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Cuba Fell Short in Venezuela and the Real Test Is Yet to Come  <br/>Mayli Estévez  <br/>February 15, 2026  <br/>Use less data when receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>On the grass of Caracas' Monumental Stadium  <br/>“Simón Bolívar,”  <br/>the Cuban baseball team received more than just a beating in the recently concluded II Series of the Americas; and the real test is still to come: the World Baseball Classic.  <br/>In the semifinal game, the Navegantes de Magallanes decisively scored nine runs against the Cubans; so decisive that even the most optimistic commentator had to condemn these players, who were supposed to be the Cuba feeder team for the Classic.  <br/>The Cubans, who came with the mission of reaching the final, seemed to be on a sightseeing tour. Yes, they scored first thanks to a single by Yoelquis Guibert, a brief respite in a sea of pitches that the Venezuelans turned into an avalanche.  <br/>After this disaster, Cuban manager Germán Mesa did not mince words and confirmed what everyone saw on the field:  <br/>“Batting failed, pitching also failed. They played better than us, they outperformed us in the fundamental aspects of baseball.”  <br/>Yes, Mesa spoke with the honesty of someone who sees reality in its harshest form. He added, pointing out the pitching shortcomings:  <br/>“We asked them to at least last two innings, to give a zero, and it was impossible.”  <br/>“I’m not used to disputing third places. Our idea was to fight for first place, but with the team we have, third isn’t bad, although I’m not satisfied; I aspired to a little more,” Mesa lamented after that semifinal.  <br/><br/>What Will the “Wizard” Really Bring? Pros and Cons of This Baseball Choice  <br/>Germán Mesa has been confirmed as manager of the Cuban team heading into the VI World Baseball Classic and even the 2028 Olympic Games.  <br/><br/>Although his appointment surprises no one, it does spark debate. Is it a safe bet or a déjà vu of already questioned decisions?  <br/>For those who sought excuses in fatigue or physical condition, Mesa bluntly clarified: “This tournament has its level. The speeds we faced have nothing to do with ours. We could have held on a little longer but things didn’t go well.” In short, Cuba ended relegated to fight for the bronze medal against Panama and, in doing so, came up short, as the management’s expectations were very high.  <br/><br/>At the time of writing, the final result of that clash against the Panamanians, who had already beaten them in the regular phase, was still unknown. Whether Cuba ended up with medals or not is not even the most important thing. Why?  <br/>Mesa’s nine went to the Series of the Americas not as the champion of the National Series or the Elite Tournament, as the other teams did. It was a Cuba team, with the Classic feeder, and reality once again showed that even heavily reinforced, they do not win titles on the international stage.  <br/><br/>After the Series of the Americas ended, the Cuban baseball scene fully shifts to the VI World Baseball Classic, where the demands will remain the same. At the Round Table on February 12, 2026, Carlos Martín, director of the National Series, confirmed that the team will play in Puerto Rico from March 5 to 11, facing Panama, Colombia, Canada, and the host.  <br/>He also noted that selecting players was a real puzzle due to waiting on authorizations for Cubans in MLB. Some declined, others arrived late, but according to the official side, the team was assembled with the best available players.  <br/><br/>Cuba Has Its Team for the Classic; Neto Had a Place and Was Denied  <br/>With solid sports arguments and a genuine desire to represent Cuba, the Cuban-American MLB shortstop was left off the team not because of his level, but because of his birthplace, showing how the federation continues to give up on the talent of its diaspora in a tournament where every decision counts.  <br/><br/>According to Martín, pitching would be “the jewel of the team” at the Classic, while pitcher Raidel Martínez, from the Giants in the Japanese league, said that from now on “a lot of concentration and good preparation” was needed.  <br/>“If everything works well, we can beat anyone,” said the relief pitcher from Pinar del Río with perhaps too much optimism.  <br/><br/>Thus, after the painful reminder left by the Series of the Americas and the optimism of national baseball officials, preparation for the World Classic seems more like a rehearsal of frustrations than a path to revenge.  <br/>With an incomplete team,  <br/>absences of key figures  <br/>and pitchers still adjusting their form, logic indicates that repeating stumbles is much more likely than starring in feats.  <br/><br/>For fans, hope is measured in small victories: that the team survives the group stage and that, at least, the errors are bearable. Cuban baseball’s epic is on pause and it’s unknown for how long.  <br/><br/>ELTOQUE  <br/>IS A CREATIVE SPACE OPEN TO DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Fernández Era's Column: Botched Jobs  <br/>Jorge Fernández Era  <br/>February 14, 2026  <br/>Use less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>Illustration: Herbert  <br/><br/>Fernández Era's Column: Botched Jobs  <br/>Jorge Fernández Era  <br/>February 14, 2026  <br/>Use less data receiving our content on  <br/>WhatsApp  <br/>or  <br/>Telegram  <br/><br/>—Have you really given up the Granma newspaper? You deprive yourself of reading, once in a while and every twenty years, a substantial article.  <br/>—Are you referring to a specific one?  <br/>—Yes. “Applauding the botched jobs: praises that destroy the future” must be a botch by the censors of the Party’s official organ. They let slip a title that “points to the core of a contradiction that, if not resolved, gnaws from within the social project we defend. It is about rejecting that this reality be used as an excuse for mediocrity, neglect, and lack of professionalism.”  <br/>—It’s not fair to speak that way about a president who says that “In Cuba what we are thinking about is leaving …  <br/>—That would be magnificent!  <br/>—…despite the difficulties.”  <br/>—But he is not referring to himself. The author clarifies that “The Cuban Revolution was built, precisely, against botched jobs.”  <br/>—He started badly. The columnist, I mean. Because this process has enthroned botched jobs as a way of life. Weren’t the Revolutionary Offensive (and its later counteroffensives), the Ten Million Sugar Harvest (which nowadays is the Hundred Thousand Harvest), or this Alamar apartment that the Commander, who liked showing it to his friends, predicted from a 1964 speech: “We cannot now aspire to make things as beautiful as we can aspire to in twenty years, but we must try to avoid making them so ugly now that in twenty years we will be ashamed of what we are doing.” —all blunders?  <br/>—“The real danger (says ‘Applauding the botched jobs…’) is not that the enemy uses our deficiencies as propaganda, but that we ourselves normalize low quality as if it were inherent to socialism.”  <br/>—It is. It is normalized that “corrections” only steer towards a worse path. There are the Reordering and the current “Government Program to correct distortions and re-boost the economy.” They correct the economy and re-boost distortions.  <br/>—The journalist says very pertinent things, like “Demanding quality, responsibility, and neatness in everything done (from national policies to fixing a faucet) is not being ‘demanding’ or ‘perfectionist’: it is being revolutionary,” but he errs by throwing a blanket over the national policies, which boast of acting as “socialist” and are mainly responsible for a doctor providing poor care out of laziness, a worker delivering a poorly done job, the bus not arriving on time, or the bread not having quality, examples the columnist uses to prove that “Socialism deserving that name cannot be the realm of ‘more or less.’ It is either efficient, dignified, and well done, or it will not be.”  <br/>—It never has been. Just look at how much deceit and confusion are present in other works published by the press.  <br/>—That make people “not reject botched jobs in the name of socialism, but end up rejecting socialism because of botched jobs.”  <br/>—Granma insists that “The strategy is to produce.” It exemplifies with “between 11 and 15 tons of sausages, meat mass, and croquette mixture produced by Prodal.” It also highlights an intervention by Marrero stating that “Cuba will not stop, Cuba will not halt, what we are doing is to keep moving forward.”  <br/>—He is right. The bus that transports us has a strong reverse gear.  <br/>—And it has run out of fuel long before what happened in Venezuela. Morales Ojeda, however, affirms that “we will get out of this situation that will ultimately lead us to achieve energy sovereignty.”  <br/>—Energetic and sovereign Raúl Torres, the king of “more or less.” He composed an “Urgent North American Song” where he speaks of how “last night they broke into the house” of his “brother Maduro,” the “giant in love.”  <br/>—A man who, “madly” in love with his kidnappers, nearly thanks them for taking him to New York.  <br/>—He leaves in power a Delcy Rodríguez who increasingly depends on Washington’s power.  <br/>—Raulito will dedicate his melody to her. In a Cubadebate piece, he defends “our right to build our own socialism, imperfect, even ‘invented,’ but ours.”  <br/>—He accepts that we live off invention. Own, perfect, and ours.  <br/>—He praises Bad Bunny. He states that “the Bad Bunny just gave a huge lesson to all the traitors” in the United States Super Bowl halftime show.  <br/>—Perhaps he is declaring his eternal willingness to sing at the full-time shows of the Anti-Imperialist Tribune.</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>La columna de Fernández Era: Chapucerías<br/>Jorge Fernández Era<br/>febrero 14, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>Ilustración: Herbert<br/>Ilustración: Herbert<br/>La columna de Fernández Era: Chapucerías<br/>Jorge Fernández Era<br/>febrero 14, 2026<br/>Gasta menos datos recibiendo nuestro contenido en<br/>WhatsApp<br/>o<br/>Telegram<br/>—¿De verdad que has renunciado al periódico<br/>Granma<br/>?
