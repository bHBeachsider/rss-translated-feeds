Between mobility constraints, administrative delays, and logistical obstacles, time is a scarce resource. In this context, the digital transformation of public procedures appears as a pragmatic response to concrete needs.<br/>It is worth noting that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) launched a digital version of the Professional Identity Card (CIP) through its One-Stop Shop guichet.mci.ht/cip, as part of a modernization program supported by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). This reform, although partial, reveals a gradual approach to administrative modernization.<br/>A dominant informal economy:<br/>More than 80% of total employment in Haiti is in the informal sector, which constitutes the main driver of the national economy (UNDP 2021).<br/>Available estimates suggest that this sector represents a significant share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), often estimated at over 50% when unregistered activities are taken into account (World Bank 2021).<br/>In the Caribbean region, approximately 91% of Haiti's active workforce operates in the informal sector, without social protection or formal legal recognition (ILO 2025).<br/>These figures reveal a structural reality: the Haitian economy relies heavily on independent actors who operate on the margins of or outside formal registration channels.<br/>Who is the digitized CIP really for?<br/>The digital version of the CIP is primarily intended for individual entrepreneurs and sole proprietorships that regularly conduct business. Specifically, this refers to individuals who buy and resell goods, provide professional or commercial services, and whose activity constitutes a source of income.<br/>However, companies constituted as legal entities (such as public limited companies or other structured business forms) are not yet integrated into the system as it currently operates. This reflects a gradual implementation rather than an immediate systemic transformation.<br/>How does the procedure work today?<br/>Step 1: Creating an online account. The applicant registers on the MCI's One-Stop Shop platform and creates a personal space to initiate their CIP application.<br/>Step 2: Uploading documents. The online form requires:<br/>- National Identification Card (CIN),<br/>- Tax Identification Number (NIF),<br/>- Supporting documents for the business activity.<br/>Step 3: Payment of fees. The application fees are paid directly on the platform via MonCash or NatCash. This option facilitates access for sole traders who already make extensive use of mobile payments, but limits the use of traditional banking channels.<br/>Step 4: Online Tracking. The applicant can track the progress of their application via the platform. A QR code is generated and shared with the cardholder; it is printed on the physical card and allows the relevant authorities to verify the document's authenticity.<br/>Step 5: Collection of the Physical Card. Once the application is approved, the CIP (Professional Identity Card) must be collected from the Ministry's offices. At this stage, it remains a physical document, not an electronic card or a fully digital identifier.<br/>Concrete Benefits of this System<br/>Although partial, the reform is producing tangible results:<br/>Reduced processing times, thanks to digital tracking;<br/>Fewer physical trips to administrative offices, particularly relevant in a context of reduced mobility;<br/>Increased payment traceability, via secure methods such as MonCash and NatCash;<br/>Improved accessibility for unbanked actors, who are numerous in the informal sector.<br/>In an economy where time, security, and transportation costs weigh on competitiveness, these gains are significant.<br/>Limitations and Structural Challenges<br/>The reform raises several important questions:<br/>Limited Scope and Sequencing:<br/>The exclusive targeting of sole proprietorships leaves the needs of more complex commercial structures unaddressed.<br/>Legal Framework for Data:<br/>Digitalization implies the collection and management of personal data. However, the Haitian legal framework for the protection of digital identity remains underdeveloped, which poses challenges in terms of security, confidentiality, and institutional trust.<br/>Diversification of payment methods:<br/>The lack of other payment methods (beyond MonCash and NatCash) limits access for some formal players accustomed to traditional banking processes.<br/>Integration with business registries:<br/>Expanded formalization will require better coordination between the Professional Identity Card (CIP), tax registries, and other business registration systems.<br/>Do not confuse the National Identity Card (CIN) and the Professional Identity Card (CIP)<br/>It is crucial for citizens not to confuse these two documents, as their functions differ legally:<br/>The National Identification Card (CIN), managed by the National Identification Office (ONI), defines civil and political identity. It is mandatory for voting and performing civil acts (marriage, property purchase, etc.);<br/>The Professional Identity Card (CIP), managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI), certifies a business or professional status. It is the economic formalization tool, essential for opening business bank accounts and conducting transactions with the State.<br/>HL/ HaitiLibre<br/>Why HaitiLibre?<br/>|<br/>Contact us<br/>|<br/>French<br/>Copyright © 2010 - 2026<br/>Haitilibre.com</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>﻿<br/>Haiti - Economy : All the details on the digitized Professional Identity Card (CIP) - HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7<br/>Home<br/>Français<br/>Politic<br/>Economy<br/>Education<br/>Health<br/>Culture<br/>Tourism<br/>Environnement<br/>COVID-19<br/>Social<br/>Security<br/>Justice<br/>Sports<br/>Elections<br/>Reconstruction<br/>Technology<br/>Agriculture<br/>Humanitarian<br/>iciHaiti.com<br/>Download the revised decree and electoral calendar, published in the official journal<br/>Haiti - Dominican Rep. : Exports to Haiti on the rise (January 2026)<br/>iciHaiti - Security : Only 65.5% of the Haitian National Police's armored vehicles are operational<br/>iciHaiti - Skiing : Haitian Richard...</p>]]></description>

They are not subject to any summons, arrest warrant, or warrant issued against them under Articles 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, and following of the Code of Criminal Procedure;  <br/>To date, the names of those involved do not appear in any investigation report from the Central Unit for Economic and Financial Intelligence (UCREF) or the Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC) regarding the crimes of financing terrorism and money laundering with which they are charged by the DCPJ.  <br/>The RNDDH recognizes the obligation of DCPJ agents to conduct investigations to establish the truth within the framework of ongoing legal proceedings. However, the RNDDH emphasizes that these investigations must be conducted in strict compliance with judicial guarantees such as the presumption of innocence, prior and detailed notification of the charges, and the right to a fair trial, enshrined in the Haitian Constitution on the one hand, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the American Convention on Human Rights on the other, instruments to which Haiti is a party.  <br/>The RNDDH emphasizes that, lacking a legal framework, wanted notices can only be logically understood and acceptable in cases where the individuals concerned are fugitives, either after being caught in the act of committing an offense, pursued by public outcry, having escaped from prison, or being subject to an arrest warrant. However, the individuals targeted by these wanted notices fall into none of these categories. Furthermore, their good faith and willingness to cooperate with a potential judicial police investigation have never been tested, as they have not been summoned beforehand by the DCPJ.  <br/>The RNDDH reiterates that under no circumstances should the judicial police be used as a tool, as this would constitute a clear violation of the principles of the democratic rule of law. The National Network for the Defense of Human Rights (RNDDH) denounces the absurd, illegal, and arbitrary nature of these wanted notices and emphasizes that a wanted notice cannot be the trigger for an investigation or prosecution by the judicial police.  <br/>In conclusion, the RNDDH recommends that the DCPJ suspend these wanted notices and adhere to the law for all investigations conducted by the institution.  <br/><br/>Photo caption  <br/>from left to right:  <br/>Arnel Belizaire, Ralph Youri Chevry, Smith Joseph, and Edouard Julcene  <br/>HL/HaitiLibre  <br/>Why HaitiLibre?  <br/>|  <br/>Contact us  <br/>|  <br/>French  <br/>Copyright © 2010 - 2026  <br/>Haitilibre.com</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>﻿<br/>Haiti - Justice : RNDDH denounces the absurd, illegal, and arbitrary nature of 4 wanted issued by the DCPJ - HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7<br/>Home<br/>Français<br/>Politic<br/>Economy<br/>Education<br/>Health<br/>Culture<br/>Tourism<br/>Environnement<br/>COVID-19<br/>Social<br/>Security<br/>Justice<br/>Sports<br/>Elections<br/>Reconstruction<br/>Technology<br/>Agriculture<br/>Humanitarian<br/>iciHaiti.com<br/>Download the revised decree and electoral calendar, published in the official journal<br/>Haiti - Dominican Rep. : Exports to Haiti on the rise (January 2026)<br/>iciHaiti - Security : Only 65.5% of the Haitian National Police's armored vehicles are operational<br/>iciHaiti - S...</p>]]></description>

The Anse-à-Veau detention center houses inmates from the local jurisdiction, as well as from Miragoâne, making it a space requiring special attention to healthcare.  <br/>A concrete response to healthcare needs in prisons  <br/>Often facing difficult detention conditions, incarcerated individuals suffer from numerous health conditions requiring urgent and regular medical care. During this mobile clinic, DSNI managers and healthcare staff mobilized to provide consultations, assess priority cases, and distribute appropriate medications.  <br/>Several inmates suffering from illnesses such as influenza, fever, tuberculosis, and other common ailments received immediate care in an atmosphere marked by high levels of satisfaction and numerous expressions of gratitude.  <br/>A Mission guided by a humanitarian vision of public health  <br/>This activity was carried out under the leadership of the Minister of Public Health and Population, Dr. Sinal Bertrand, and is part of the initiative launched by the Director of the DSNI, Dr. Esther Ceus Dumont, who was present to support the team and provide initial guidance for the continuation of these crucial interventions.  <br/>In a powerful statement, the Director emphasized the profound meaning of this action:  <br/>"An incarcerated person is not a person condemned to die of illness."  <br/>Prison is a place where sentences are served, not a place of torture or neglect. Saving lives remains our priority, even behind bars.  <br/>She emphasized that detention should never mean the deprivation of the fundamental right to health.  <br/>A commitment extended beyond the mobile clinic  <br/>In a spirit of continuity, on Thursday, February 12, a few days after the mobile clinic, a team of health officers from the Nippes department returned to the site to assess the conditions of the prison sub-center. This technical visit aims to prepare sanitation measures and strengthen health protocols within the detention area, thus confirming the DSNI's commitment to intervene not only through curative care, but also through preventive and structural actions in the prison environment.  <br/>An initiative welcomed by prison authorities  <br/>Prison officials and other relevant authorities welcomed this intervention by the Nippes Health Directorate (DSNI), emphasizing the importance of such actions in an environment where healthcare needs are often immense.  <br/>Through these activities, the Nippes Health Directorate reaffirms its commitment to guaranteeing quality care for all, without discrimination, and to strengthening community-based services for the benefit of the department's most vulnerable populations.  <br/>HL/ HaitiLibre  <br/>Why HaitiLibre?  <br/>|  <br/>Contact us  <br/>|  <br/>French  <br/>Copyright © 2010 - 2026  <br/>Haitilibre.com</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>﻿<br/>Haiti - Health : «An incarcerated person is not condemned to die of illness» - HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7<br/>Home<br/>Français<br/>Politic<br/>Economy<br/>Education<br/>Health<br/>Culture<br/>Tourism<br/>Environnement<br/>COVID-19<br/>Social<br/>Security<br/>Justice<br/>Sports<br/>Elections<br/>Reconstruction<br/>Technology<br/>Agriculture<br/>Humanitarian<br/>iciHaiti.com<br/>Download the revised decree and electoral calendar, published in the official journal<br/>Haiti - Dominican Rep. : Exports to Haiti on the rise (January 2026)<br/>iciHaiti - Security : Only 65.5% of the Haitian National Police's armored vehicles are operational<br/>iciHaiti - Skiing : Haitian Richardson Via...</p>]]></description>

This initiative is part of international support aimed at strengthening the operational capacities of Haitian law enforcement in the context of a precarious and deteriorating security situation.  <br/>André François Giroux reaffirmed his country's unwavering support for efforts to restore security in Haiti, while Alix Didier Fils-Aimé welcomed this contribution, renewed the government's commitment to restoring public order to ensure the free movement of citizens, and called on the population to cooperate with law enforcement against armed groups. "There can be no political stability, economic recovery, or social cohesion without the full and complete restoration of republican order," he declared. He emphasized that the gradual strengthening of the Haitian National Police's (PNH) material and operational capabilities is part of a comprehensive plan to create the necessary conditions for holding free, inclusive, transparent, and democratic elections.  <br/>The objective is clear: to secure the main roads, protect strategic institutions, and guarantee a climate of trust for all citizens.  <br/>It should be noted that in early February, the Haitian National Police (PNH) received three tracked armored fighting vehicles, a donation from South Korea (https://www.icihaiti.com/en/news-46793-icihaiti-south-korea-the-pnh-receives-a-donation-of-armored-tanks.html), with formidable firepower (https://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-46799-haiti-security-big-firepower-of-tanks-donated-by-south-korea.html).  <br/>With this new delivery, the PNH now has a total of 35 vehicles. Armored vehicles have been received, including three highly sophisticated tracked armored vehicles specially adapted for difficult terrain and offensive operations against heavily armed gangs. This logistical increase reflects a sustained and structured effort to enhance mobility, rapid response capabilities, and the protection of officers deployed in the field.  <br/>This equipment arrives at an opportune time, as the Haitian National Police (PNH) recently launched Operation "Operasyon San Kanpe" (https://www.icihaiti.com/en/news-46847-icihaiti-pnh-new-operations-to-clear-roads-and-dismantle-gangs.html), aimed at definitively dismantling the gangs, clearing national highways, and restoring state authority.  <br/>S/ HaitiLibre  <br/>Why HaitiLibre?  <br/>|  <br/>Contact us  <br/>|  <br/>French  <br/>Copyright © 2010 - 2026  <br/>Haitilibre.com</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>﻿<br/>Haiti - FLASH : 10 More Armored Vehicles for Haiti - HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7<br/>Home<br/>Français<br/>Politic<br/>Economy<br/>Education<br/>Health<br/>Culture<br/>Tourism<br/>Environnement<br/>COVID-19<br/>Social<br/>Security<br/>Justice<br/>Sports<br/>Elections<br/>Reconstruction<br/>Technology<br/>Agriculture<br/>Humanitarian<br/>iciHaiti.com<br/>Download the revised decree and electoral calendar, published in the official journal<br/>Haiti - Dominican Rep. : Exports to Haiti on the rise (January 2026)<br/>iciHaiti - Security : Only 65.5% of the Haitian National Police's armored vehicles are operational<br/>iciHaiti - Skiing : Haitian Richardson Viano ranked 29th best slalom...</p>]]></description>
