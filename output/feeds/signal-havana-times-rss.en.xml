<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>The Cuban Professor Sentenced to 10 Years for Graffiti  <br/>February 18, 2026  <br/>Photo: Facebook of the Observatory of Academic Freedom.  <br/>Ariel Manuel Martin was held “incommunicado for five or six months” after his detention in February 2025, his cousin told El Toque.  <br/>By Raul Medina Orama (El Toque)  <br/>HAVANA TIMES — Ariel Manuel Martin Barroso has not set foot on a university campus for almost a year, although he has more than enough credentials to lead a classroom. The professor from the Faculty of Technical and Business Sciences at the University of Sancti Spíritus was sentenced in September 2025 to a combined penalty of ten years in prison for painting phrases against the Communist Party regime; some were directed at President Miguel Diaz-Canel. However, since February 25, 2025, he had already been enduring the rigors of political imprisonment, which allegedly caused him severe depression, according to family sources consulted by El Toque.  <br/>“He is an extremely noble person; he’s never been ‘streetwise.’ We didn’t dare publicize this out of fear they would retaliate more against him in prison, but the abuse is already too much and we decided to make his case known,” his cousin Jorge Luis González, who lives in the United States, explained to the outlet.  <br/>According to a ruling from the Provincial People’s Court of Villa Clara, accessed by El Toque, the charges used to convict Martín Barroso were “propaganda against the constitutional order” and “contempt.” In the proceedings, he was accused of writing anti-government slogans on walls at the Sancti Spiritus university and other locations around the city at various times between 2024 and early 2025.  <br/>The Observatory of Academic Freedom — the organization that first reported the case — describes the political prisoner as a “researcher and professor with institutional prestige and recognition among students,” worthy of distinction as “author of the best doctoral thesis” of 2023 in the Faculty of Accounting and Finance at the University of Havana.  <br/>On January 15, 2024, the University of Sancti Espiritus congratulated Ariel Manuel Martín Barroso (among other professors) on its official Facebook page for obtaining the academic rank of PhD in Sciences. Martin also served as a member of the National Accreditation Board of the Ministry of Higher Education.  <br/>According to the Observatory of Academic Freedom, the professor “was subjected to surveillance by State Security agents who monitor the university campus, and who testified against him”; they prejudged him, labeling him a habitual “suspect” because of “the way he conducted himself against the revolutionary process.”  <br/>The ruling obtained by El Toque identifies State Security officer Arianna Rojas Díaz and Interior Ministry (Minint) officer Dania Iris Rodríguez — agents “assigned to the university” — as witnesses for the prosecution.  <br/>To convict the political prisoner, the judges of the Villa Clara court — Grisel Santos Suarez, Noralmis Blanco Echarte, and Ricardo Hernandez Domínguez — also considered testimony from the university rector, Edelvy Bravo Amarante, and the provincial Transportation delegate in Sancti Spíritus, Jose Lorenzo Garcia.  <br/>Ileana Curra Lusson, a former political prisoner and exile who published part of the ruling, has reported that the university professor is being held at the maximum-security “Nieves Morejón” prison (Sancti Spíritus), a facility with “countless complaints about inhumane and unsanitary conditions, as well as abuse of inmates.”  <br/>Ariel Manuel Martín was held “incommunicado for five or six months” after his detention in February 2025, his cousin Jorge Luis Gonzalez told El Toque.  <br/>The relative says that during some prison visits Martin Barroso has appeared “very depressed, but Ariel is not someone who talks much and he expresses little about what he is going through in there.”  <br/>According to Gonzalez, his cousin had made no public political statements for most of his life. However, “he is a fan of the works of Cuban national hero Jose Martí, and we used to talk about that, which gradually changed his thinking” about the country’s situation.  <br/>One event is identified by the family member as a trigger for the university professor’s politicization, at least in private. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ariel’s mother died of cancer at home without receiving adequate medical care, according to Gonzalez.  <br/>“That was his breaking point. During one of our last conversations, he told me: ‘Cousin, I’m already 40 years old — what am I in life, with so many degrees and studies? What am I in this country? Nobody,’” the relative recounts.  <br/>The case of the Sancti Spíritus academic is not unusual in Cuba. A special report by the Observatory of Academic Freedom, published in December 2025, documented at least 18 cases of Cuban professors and students “victims of government repression against the July 11, 2021 protesters.”  <br/>Following those mass protests across the country, the persecution of regime critics has not diminished. Different human rights organizations record between 753 and 1,207 people imprisoned for demonstrating in public spaces, affiliating with dissident groups, or expressing opinions on social media.  <br/>Cuban economist Mauricio de Miranda Parrono, a professor at the Javeriana University of Cali (Colombia), described the proceedings against Ariel Manuel Martín as a “vulgar injustice” that “only occurs in dictatorial regimes.”  <br/>De Miranda Parrono added on Facebook: “While the country sinks into the most terrible misery, amid the incompetence and neglect of those who cling at all costs to power; and the external pressures that batter an entire society that can no longer endure — it seems the only resources available [to the State] (…) are devoted to the cruelest repression.”  <br/>In reality, the “crime” the authorities cannot forgive is his consistency with the writings of Jose Marti, one of his intellectual heroes: “Freedom is the right that every man has to be honorable, and to think and speak without hypocrisy. (…) A man who obeys a bad government, without working to make the government good, is not an honorable man.”  <br/>The Observatory of Academic Freedom has called on the international academic community for “solidarity, accompaniment, and amplification of such a grave human rights violation.”  <br/>Meanwhile, people close to Ariel Manuel Martín hope that breaking the silence about his case will help the university professor obtain justice. “That young man is a brilliant mind — the pride of the family,” his cousin Jorge Luis González concluded.  <br/>El Toque sent requests for comment to the Ministry of Higher Education and the University of Sancti Spiritus regarding Professor Martín Barroso’s situation and Observatory of Academic Freedom’s statement, but as of the publication of this article, no response had been received.  <br/>First published in Spanish  <br/>by El Toque  <br/>and translated and posted in English by Havana Times.  <br/>Read more from Cuba here on Havana Times.</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>The Cuban Professor Sentenced to 10-Years for Graffiti<br/>February 18, 2026<br/>Photo: Facebook of the Observatory of Academic Freedom.<br/>Ariel Manuel Martin was held “incommunicado for five or six months” after his detention in February 2025, his cousin told El Toque.<br/>By Raul Medina Orama (El Toque)<br/>HAVANA TIMES — Ariel Manuel Martin Barroso has not set foot on a university campus for almost a year, although he has more than enough credentials to lead a classroom.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>International News Briefs for Wednesday, February 18, 2026<br/>February 18, 2026<br/>HAVANA TIMES – We bring you some of the top international news stories compiled by<br/>Democracy Now<br/>on Wednesday, February 18, 2026.<br/>U.S. Military Says It Carried Out Strikes on Three Boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, Killing at Least 11 People<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Image Credit: SouthCom/X<br/>The U.S. military says it carried out strikes on three boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing at least 11 people and again providing no evidence the boats were allegedly carrying drugs. Since September, the U.S. military has carried out 42 known strikes on small vessels in waters near Latin America, killing at least 145 people total. The recent strikes come weeks after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and abducted its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, who are to face trial in New York on drugs, weapons and narcoterrorism charges. The Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy organization, said, “Those being killed by US military strikes at sea are denied any due process whatsoever.”<br/>Iran’s Foreign Minister: U.S. and Iranian Negotiators Have Agreed on “Guiding Principles” on Iran’s Nuclear Program<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>As U.S. and Iranian officials held negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program in Geneva Tuesday, Iran temporarily closed parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a key international waterway through which 20% of the world’s oil passes. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned, “The strongest army in the world might sometimes receive such a slap that it cannot get back on its feet.” Tehran’s foreign minister cautioned that more work still needs to be done on reaching a nuclear deal, but expressed some optimism about the negotiations.<br/>Abbas Araghchi<br/>: “I can say that in this round there were quite serious discussions and a more constructive atmosphere than in the previous round. Various ideas were raised, and these ideas were seriously discussed. And finally, we were able to reach a general agreement on a series of guiding principles. From now on, we will move based on those principles and enter into the text of a possible agreement.”<br/>Mehdi Mahmoudian, Oscar-Nominated Co-Writer of “It Was Just an Accident,” Released from Iranian Prison<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Image Credit: Reuters<br/>Mehdi Mahmoudian, the Oscar-nominated co-writer of the film “It Was Just an Accident,” has been released from an Iranian prison. Earlier this month, Mahmoudian was arrested in Tehran after he signed a statement condemning Khamenei and the regime’s violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrators.<br/>Click here to see our interview with the filmmaker Jafar Panahi<br/>.<br/>Peru’s Congress Impeaches Interim Peruvian President José Jerí<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Peru’s Congress has impeached interim Peruvian President José Jerí for failing to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen who were under investigation. His ouster came just about four months after taking office. Jerí is the former head of Peru’s Congress who also oversaw the removal of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte. Jerí is the sixth Peruvian president in the past decade to leave office before the end of a term. Residents of the capital Lima took to the streets to celebrate Jerí’s impeachment.<br/>Lima resident<br/>: “Very good. Long live Peru! We’re always standing, never kneeling. Now I tell my suffering people, which have been subjected to thousands of forms of slavery, ‘Never again. Not one more vote to these far-right parties.’ We will not trust them at all, because they’ve proven their immorality and incapacity.”<br/>Peru is scheduled to hold a general election on April 12.<br/>Federal Judge Blocks Efforts by Trump Administration to Rearrest Kilmar Ábrego García<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>A federal judge has blocked efforts by the Trump administration to rearrest Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland father who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT mega-prison last March. Since his return to the United States in June, Ábrego García has been fighting repeated deportation threats, as DHS has intended to send him to several African countries he has no ties to. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said in her ruling Tuesday the Trump administration “made one empty threat after another to remove him to countries in Africa with no real chance of success. … There is no ‘good reason to believe’ removal is likely in the reasonably foreseeable future.”<br/>Ábrego García’s legal team has said he had agreed to the possibility of being removed to Costa Rica, but Judge Xinis blasted the Trump administration for “purposely — and for no reason — ignored the one country that has consistently offered to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee, and to which he agrees to go.”<br/>Click here to see all our coverage of Kilmar Ábrego García’s case<br/>.<br/>Immigration Judge Blocks Trump Administration from Deporting Mohsen Mahdawi<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Image Credit: AP/Amanda Swinhart<br/>An immigration judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting Mohsen Mahdawi, a graduate of Columbia University who was detained last April over his outspoken support for Palestinian rights. Mahdawi is a green card holder from the occupied West Bank and was arrested by ICE in Vermont when he appeared for what he was told would be a U.S. citizenship interview. He spent more than two weeks in ICE custody. After news his deportation proceedings had been terminated, Mahdawi said in a statement, “In a climate where dissent is increasingly met with intimidation and detention, today’s ruling renews hope that due process still applies and that no agency stands above the Constitution. This is not the end of the story. It is the beginning of a deeper commitment to peace, dignity, and justice.”<br/>Click here to see our interviews with Mohsen Mahdawi<br/>.<br/>DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin Announces Her Resignation<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, one of the most vocal supporters of President Trump’s immigration crackdown and deportation campaign, is resigning. The move comes amid intensifying scrutiny over DHS’s use of deadly force and public backlash against President Trump’s deployment of federal agents to Chicago, Minneapolis and other cities nationwide.<br/>Earlier this year, Public Citizen reported that McLaughlin’s husband’s company, The Strategy Group, was granted part of a $220 million contract to run an anti-immigration advertising campaign for DHS. ProPublica also reported last year that McLaughlin’s husband, Ben Yoho, worked on one of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s ads filmed at Mount Rushmore.<br/>This comes as calls grow for Noem’s impeachment and resignation. Following news of McLaughlin’s departure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on social media, “Another MAGA extremist forced out of DHS. Noem next. Keep the pressure on.”<br/>Two-Month-Old Baby Detained at ICE Jail in Dilley, Texas, Deported Along with His Family<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>A 2-month-old baby, Juan Nicolás, who became gravely ill while detained at ICE’s South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, has been deported to Mexico along with his parents and 16-month-old sibling. That’s according to Texas Congressmember Joaquin Castro, who had demanded the baby’s release after news he had been rushed to the hospital on Monday. Baby Juan had reportedly been detained at Dilley for about a month. Univision reporter Lidia Terrazas had spoken to Juan’s mom, who told her the baby had suffered a health episode, choking on his own vomit. When he was taken to Dilley’s medical area, guards were told there was no doctor available inside the facility at that time.<br/>Tarique Rahman Sworn In As Bangladesh’s New Prime Minister<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>In Bangladesh, the country’s new prime minister, Tarique Rahman, was sworn in Tuesday after his party’s landslide win in parliamentary elections. Rahman returned to Bangladesh last year after 17 years of self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom. Voters also approved a raft of changes to Bangladesh’s constitution aimed at preventing authoritarianism. This comes after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was sentenced to death for ordering a deadly crackdown on student protesters who successfully toppled her government in 2024. The U.N. reports 1,400 people were killed and thousands were injured in the crackdown.<br/>Independent Journalist Georgia Fort and Activist Trahern Crews Plead Not Guilty in Federal Court in Minnesota<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Image Credit: Georgia Fort<br/>In Minnesota, independent journalist Georgia Fort and activist Trahern Crews pleaded not guilty in federal court in St. Paul yesterday. They were indicted on federal charges in connection with a protest last month at a St. Paul church where the pastor is also an ICE official. On Friday, journalist Don Lemon also pleaded not guilty, along with four others, including protest leader and civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. This is Georgia Fort, speaking to supporters gathered outside the federal courthouse in St. Paul Tuesday. She called attention to the attacks on journalists in the U.S. and around the world.<br/>Georgia Fort<br/>: “This is a global crisis. According to Al Jazeera, more than 250 journalists and members of the media have been killed in Gaza. And most people don’t even know about it. We live in a time when AI images and AI videos are shaping our world’s reality, with a portion of our society living in delusion. So, if you stand for truth, I need you to stand up today!”<br/>“Late Show” Host Colbert Blasts Trump Admin After CBS Pulls Interview with Texas Democrat Talarico<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Image Credit: CBS<br/>“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert is accusing the Trump administration and CBS of censorship after the network informed the “Late Show” that Colbert couldn’t air an interview with James Talarico, a Texas Democrat running for Senate. CBS said in a statement, “The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Texas State Representative James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the Federal Communications Commission’s equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Representative Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” The FCC had previously issued an exemption for the equal time rule for news interviews, but earlier this year FCC Chair Brendan Carr mentioned that he was considering dropping the exemption specifically for talk shows. Earlier this month, the FCC opened an investigation into the ABC show “The View,” which also interviewed Talarico. Colbert’s interview with Talarico was ultimately posted on YouTube, outside the jurisdiction of the FCC. It garnered 5 million views. Here’s Colbert last night, insisting that CBS barred him from conducting his interview with Talarico live on the “Late Show” broadcast.<br/>Stephen Colbert<br/>: “Between the monologue I did last night and before I did the second act talking about this issue, I had to go backstage. I got called backstage to get more notes from these lawyers, something that had never, ever happened before. And they told us the language they wanted me to use to describe that equal time exception, and I used that language. So I don’t know what this is about.”<br/>CBS is currently owned by Paramount Skydance, run by Trump ally David Ellison, the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who has repeatedly visited the White House during President Trump’s second term. Paramount has restarted talks with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the company, after Warner Bros. previously rejected Paramount’s hostile takeover bid last year. The takeover would require the approval of Trump’s FCC.<br/>Read more news here on Havana Times.</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>International News Briefs for Wednesday, February 18, 2026<br/>February 18, 2026<br/>HAVANA TIMES – We bring you some of the top international news stories compiled by<br/>Democracy Now<br/>on Wednesday, February 18, 2026.<br/>U.S. Military Says It Carried Out Strikes on Three Boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, Killing at Least 11 People<br/>Feb 18, 2026<br/>Image Credit: SouthCom/X<br/>The U.S. military says it carried out strikes on three boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing at least 11 people and again providing no evidence the boats were allegedly carrying drugs.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Cuba’s Dilemma: Resistance, Collapse or Negotiation?<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>under Trump’s oil siege<br/>People trying to catch a ride on a dark street during a blackout in Havana, Cuba. Photo: EFE<br/>Rafael Rojas: there are sectors proposing a return to the reformist agenda, but the official response is to “close ranks” with the Government.<br/>By Carlos F. Chamorro (Confidencial)<br/>HAVANA TIMES — Cuban historian Rafael Rojas, researcher and professor at El Colegio de México, believes that given the worsening crisis Cuba is facing under the oil siege imposed by Donald Trump and reinforced by the executive order of January 29, 2026, “migratory pressure toward a mass exodus, or a social explosion, are within the realm of reasonable expectations of what could happen in the coming weeks and months.”<br/>“If there is a social explosion, one would expect the Cuban Government’s habitual way of reacting with repression and orders for mass arrests and imprisonments. In that case, the possibility of an (US) intervention becomes more tangible,” he warned.<br/>In a conversation with the program Esta Semana, broadcast on CONFIDENCIAL’s YouTube channel due to television censorship in Nicaragua, Rojas analyzed different scenarios for overcoming the crisis of Cuba’s revolutionary model, after 67 years of wear and tear and now under “maximum pressure” from the Trump Administration.<br/>Cuba has proposed dialogue with the United States to expand cooperation on issues tied to Trump’s hemispheric security strategy (illegal migration, counternarcotics, terrorism, security). But it is not ruled out that, in exchange for economic cooperation and suspension of the embargo, the United States would demand profound political changes in the “Cuban model” — something Havana has never been willing to consider.<br/>Between these two options — which could lead to regime collapse or capitulation — a sector of Cuban society proposes resuming a political and economic reform agenda postponed since 2011. But the hardline wing of the Communist Party and the military, Rojas says, demands “closing ranks” with Miguel Diaz-Canel’s Government and instead imposing a “counter-reform.”<br/>Cuba was already going through a severe energy crisis since last year. What impact has the closing of the Venezuelan oil spigot — imposed by the United States — and Trump’s executive order threatening tariffs on countries exporting oil to Cuba had on the economy and daily life?<br/>Trump’s executive order of January 29 adds to a depression in Cuba’s economic and social indicators that has been unfolding since 2021, when that social explosion occurred — a series of mass protests across the island.<br/>Since then, there has been an enormous drop in productivity and GDP, shortages of basic food and medicines, inflation, a fall in the real minimum wage, impoverishment, rising inequality, and worsening living conditions.<br/>The executive order comes in the context of the suspension of Venezuelan oil subsidies after the US military operation in Caracas on January 3. The decline of Venezuelan subsidies over the last five years even led Mexico to replace Venezuela as Cuba’s main fuel supplier last year.<br/>What is the situation right now? What oil reserves does Cuba have before a total paralysis occurs?<br/>Energy specialists on Cuba, such as Professor Jorge Piñón, argue that Cuba has domestic fuel production sufficient to supply up to 40% of the infrastructure and economic needs.<br/>President Miguel Díaz-Canel said on February 5 that there has been no external oil supply since December. However, in Mexico there was talk of shipments during the first 15 days of January. In the last month, the Cuban Government has been self-supplying oil at that pace it produces.<br/>What is under debate is the concept of collapse. Cuban economists, sociologists, and demographers — especially amid rising mass emigration — have used that concept for years, since the 2021 protests. But now collapse refers to national paralysis due to energy shortages. That said, total paralysis would never occur, because the Government could endure with self-supply, although 40% or below.<br/>Cuban historian and researcher Rafael Rojas. Photo: Cubaencuentro<br/>This crisis is also hitting tourism, especially Canadian tourism, which represents over 60% of visitors. How do blackouts, transportation limits, and access to basic services affect daily life?<br/>The economic model consolidated in the first quarter of the 21st century — built on the collaboration scheme between Venezuela and Cuba promoted by Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez and rests on external oil subsidies and the concentration of development planning on tourism and family remittances.<br/>Maintaining either income stream requires, on the one hand, oil subsidies, and on the other, good relations with the United States so sanctions don’t affect remittances.<br/>Both income sources — tourism and remittances — are now severely affected. The Cuban State faces the possibility of revenue shortages which, combined with oil supply problems, limit not only international financial transactions but the functioning of economic and social life.<br/>One of the sectors immediately impacted by this energy blockade that Cuba is experiencing is electricity services, but also health services, education, water supply, so that hospitals, schools, companies, factories, and public transport can function.<br/>Compared with past crises — the 1962 Missile Crisis, the 1990s “Special Period,” the 2021 protests — what does today represent with the loss of Venezuelan subsidies and the new aggressive policy of the Trump administration?<br/>A widely used comparison has been with the “Special Period” and the “zero option” of the 1990s, when the US embargo coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialism — Cuba’s main sugar buyers.<br/>The difference is that Cuba was then a major global sugar producer for socialist markets. Today it has no comparable export commodity.<br/>What Cuba can offer amid energy shortages is tourism and remittances — both directly impacted by escalating tensions with Trump’s Government.<br/>In one week, the United States has effectively become the only solution for stable energy supply and sustained remittance flows from Cubans in that country.<br/>Trump has fueled speculation about negotiations with Cuba. Is there evidence? Is there any evidence of negotiations? And if so, what would the United States be seeking?<br/>I’ve seen no concrete reports confirming negotiations.<br/>What we have heard are statements from Deputy Cuban Foreign Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossío about conversations and message exchanges at high levels.<br/>Cuba has offered greater collaboration with the US on hemispheric security: drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal migration in the Greater Caribbean, cybersecurity, counterterrorism, maritime and border security.<br/>Such cooperation has existed before, but now Havana is offering to expand it — while also calling for global solidarity, drawing analogies between Cuba and Gaza to generate international media and ideological impact.<br/>At the same time, domestic discourse emphasizes sacrifice, revolutionary intransigence, and refusal to negotiate under pressure or political conditions.<br/>The United States is moving in the direction of issues, Cuba points out, that coincide with its anti-immigration policy, deportations, drug trafficking and also rare minerals, or is the promotion of political change, or regime change in Cuba, also part of its agenda?<br/>We don’t know — that’s part of the uncertainty. Marco Rubio has spoken favorably about regime change but insists the US would not directly pursue it. He has said lifting the embargo would require regime change — but that it’s not on the immediate agenda for the United States.<br/>Still, it’s difficult to separate this maximum pressure strategy from expectations of another social explosion like 2021, potentially leading to some form of intervention. The possibility can’t be ignored.<br/>Given this increased pressure, the shortages, and the possibility of social unrest, there is no clarity regarding the United States’ agenda for negotiations or regime change.<br/>I imagine that if this offer from the Cuban Foreign Ministry to expand cooperation on security issues in the Greater Caribbean is received positively by some sectors of the Trump administration, but other things would be demanded in return. The Trump administration is c<br/><br/>[...TRUNCATED...]<br/><br/>ich also includes the perceived coldness with which Delcy Rodriguez’s government has handled the matter of these 32 Cuban soldiers killed in Caracas.<br/>I lack firsthand information on ongoing military collaboration, but I would expect accelerated deterioration — as seen already in healthcare, education, and sports cooperation.<br/>How long can this crisis last? I suppose that from Cuba’s perspective they want to see it through the midterm elections in the United States, but, on the other hand, Trump has many tools at his disposal to exert pressure on Cuba.<br/>Indeed, I believe that is the Cuban government’s strategy: to hold out until November and hope that an unfavorable outcome in the US midterm elections for Trump, and a subsequent reshuffling of Congress, will lead to a reversal of the January 29th executive order and a change in the climate of extreme hostility that has prevailed in recent months.<br/>That is the Cuban government’s strategy, and between now and November, this entire solidarity campaign with Cuba will attempt to gain as much traction as possible within the Democratic Party networks in the United States. Perhaps we will see something in these months that has more or less always occurred, but not with such force or emphasis as now: Cuban intervention in a US electoral process—that is, Cuba trying to place the island’s cause on the Democrats’ electoral agenda for these November elections.<br/>Is a US-induced crisis in Cuba possible? I suppose the US has to weigh the consequences of causing a collapse in Cuba?<br/>It’s very risky for the Trump administration. It has low approval ratings, and there are very unfavorable projections for Trump and the Republican Party heading into the November elections. But anything can happen if there’s any serious outbreak of either of the two reactions I mentioned earlier: a social explosion, with the Cuban government’s usual response of repression, arrest warrants, and mass imprisonments. The other being a mass exodus. In that case, the possibility of intervention becomes much more real.<br/>When the military intervention in Venezuela occurred, many expected a different kind of reaction, both from the Venezuelan Armed Forces and from the supposed political support enjoyed by the Maduro regime. In the case of Cuba, what would the population’s reaction be? Does the pressure from the United States generate any support for the regime?<br/>Both things. There’s a segment of the population, very critical youth sectors, social media activists who are taking a very strong stance against the government and are being repressed, arrested, convicted, and sentenced to years in prison. There’s also evangelical activism mobilizing against the government. This entire critical segment of Cuban society, especially the younger generations, which has been gaining ground for years now, again since the social uprising of 2021, in its challenge to and questioning of the Cuban government and will intensify in the coming weeks.<br/>However, there are also more traditional sectors that will reaffirm their identification with the government under this new climate of hostility. Both things. And I suppose that the decisive sectors, the military bodies involved in security, are also experiencing a similar division. Perhaps not as in the case of the young people challenging the government, but rather one sector more in favor of reviving the reformist project, and another making common cause with the government.<br/>First published in Spanish by Confidencial and translated and posted in English by Havana Times.<br/>Read more from Cuba here on Havana Times.</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Cuba’s Dilemma: Resistance, Collapse or Negotiation?<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>under Trump’s oil siege<br/>People trying to catch a ride on a dark street during a blackout in Havana, Cuba.  Photo: EFE<br/>Rafael Rojas: there are sectors proposing a return to the reformist agenda, but the official response is to “close ranks” with the Government.<br/>By Carlos F.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Life in 13-Story Buildings Without Elevators in Matanzas, Cuba<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>Inaugurated in the 1980s, these buildings on the road to Varadero that were once landmarks are today an endless source of problems. / 14ymedio<br/>The elevator in the El Polinesio building has not worked for months, and in Las Panaderías it took more than two years to repair the breakdown.<br/>By Pablo Padilla Cruz (14ymedio)<br/>HAVANA TIMES — Residents of the well-known 13-story buildings in Matanzas are exhausted. Literally so. Of the four that exist, three currently have elevators with serious breakdowns; some have even been out of service for years, and the ones still operating suffer constant failures.<br/>“The elevator hasn’t worked for months, and it’s not even that old. We’ve contacted the Housing office, but they only give us half-answers,” says a resident who lives on the 11th floor.<br/>Inaugurated in the 1980s, these buildings on the road to Varadero that were once points of reference are today an inexhaustible source of problems due to lack of maintenance, affecting a large number of families who suffer insecurity and a decline in their quality of life.<br/>“I had cancer surgery some years ago and I can’t strain myself. Before, with the elevator, despite the blackouts, we could adjust to the schedules, but now I spend weeks without being able to leave the apartment. On top of that, the stairways are in bad condition, and like me there are many elderly neighbors who suffer as well. No one responds, no one provides a solution,” the woman adds.<br/>Dasiel, the administrator of the building known as El Polinesio, is also desperate over the authorities’ lack of responsibility.<br/>“My job is difficult, and the lack of responses from the Housing office to the problems makes it even more complicated. I’m responsible for 154 apartments, in addition to this one,” he explains to 14ymedio, although, by his account, he is far from the only one.<br/>“As you can see in this area, being close to the sea, there’s always wind, and the green areas are full of garbage blown in from nearby micro-dumps. We also have problems with the handrails and stairways, and as has been reported, the façade of the building is coming loose right at the front,” he adds.<br/>El Polinesio has a restaurant on its rooftop that has now been leased to a private business, creating new problems.<br/>“In the past, it had its own elevator for customers and cargo. When ours broke down, residents on the upper floors used it and saved themselves several flights. It’s not the same to go down four floors from El Polinesio as it is to climb eight from the ground floor. But now that the restaurant has been leased to private operators, they decided not to deal with repairing the elevator and instead set up a small shop there. Now there isn’t even an elevator for customers, and worst of all, the merchandise is going to be brought up using the residents’ elevator,” says Dasiel, who fears—given Housing’s responses—that the problem will not be solved in the coming years.<br/>The story of the elevators in these buildings is nothing new. After more than two years without an elevator in the 13-story building of Las Panaderías, as another of these buildings is known, and following efforts by many residents—who even appeared before the Council of State—a new one was finally installed.<br/>Nearly a decade later, the machine is still operating, but with regular malfunctions due to the initial installation errors. Photo: 14ymedio<br/>“I’ve been working on this elevator since it was installed. I only interrupted my work during the covid pandemic. Although I don’t live in the building, I’m from the neighborhood and I know the difference having—or not having—an elevator makes for those who live here,” explains Ramón.<br/>“With the blackouts, the control panel for selecting floors has problems—it won’t stop before the 4th floor. Fortunately, it does stop on the upper floors, but when we called to see if they could replace it, the technicians said there wasn’t another one available.”<br/>Ramon says the only brigade that services all the elevators in the province spends most of its time attending to the hotels in Varadero.<br/>“It seems that foreigners’ comfort has a higher priority,” he protests.<br/>Moreover, his working conditions have little to do with the paradise promised by the Revolution to workers.<br/>“I earn very little and I have to work 12-hour shifts inside the elevator. Now, with the blackouts, it’s worse because I have to calculate the time so I don’t get trapped inside. I’m already 72 years old and it’s very hard for me to get out when the elevator gets stuck between floors. Sometimes several neighbors have had to help me out. I know it won’t be long before I can’t continue this job, and even though I don’t earn much—it’s like a symbolic salary—something is something,” he says resignedly.<br/>Life in the 13-story buildings continues to be a daily struggle for their residents, who face poor planning by Housing, lack of spare parts, and the apathy of the authorities. In addition, the idea of calling firefighters to escape an unexpected breakdown can make things worse.<br/>“Firefighters are the relief for people who get stuck, because their priority is to get them out as quickly as possible, but they are the mechanics’ worst fear. They know firefighters will often act with excessive force and in a rush to extract individuals, without thinking much about the damage they’ll cause to the equipment,” says a resident of another of these blocks.<br/>“In our building,” she notes, “the firefighters hacked down with axes, weeks ago, the wooden door that gave access to the elevator machine room on the rooftop. When they arrived, the person who had the key couldn’t be located. The result: to this day there’s no door protecting that room from vandalism, theft, or unauthorized entry—something that puts the elevator’s operation at risk,” she recounts. The energy crisis also constantly strains the machinery.<br/>The ongoing disaster has also led some residents, to spare themselves the effort of going down, lowering baskets on ropes from their balconies to receive deliveries or purchases. Others, resigned, climb at their own pace, carrying everything from food to furniture to gas cylinders. And the stairs make no distinction between the healthy and the sick.<br/>First published in Spanish<br/>by 14ymedio<br/>and translated and posted in English by Havana Times.<br/>Read more from Cuba here on Havana Times.</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Life in 13-Story Buildings Without Elevators in Matanzas, Cuba<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>Inaugurated in the 1980s, these buildings on the road to Varadero that were once landmarks are today an endless source of problems. / 14ymedio<br/>The elevator in the El Polinesio building has not worked for months, and in Las Panaderías it took more than two years to repair the breakdown.<br/>By Pablo Padilla Cruz (14ymedio)<br/>HAVANA TIMES — Residents of the well-known 13-story buildings in Matanzas are exhausted.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>International News Briefs for Tuesday, February 17, 2026<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>HAVANA TIMES – We bring you some of the top international news stories compiled by Democracy Now on Tuesday, February 17, 2026.<br/><br/>Civil Rights Icon Rev. Jesse Jackson Dies at 84<br/>Feb 17, 2026<br/>Reverend Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader and two-time presidential candidate, has died at his home in Chicago at the age of 84. He was a member of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s inner circle, marching alongside him for civil rights. He was with Dr. King when he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968. Reverend Jackson was the founder and president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition in Chicago. He was the first African American to greet South African President Nelson Mandela when he came out of jail in 1990. Here’s Reverend Jesse Jackson on Democracy Now! back in 2017 shortly after President Trump first took office. He spoke about expanding the constitutional right to vote.<br/>Rev. Jesse Jackson: “When we got the right to vote in 1965, Blacks couldn’t vote. White women couldn’t serve on juries in the South. Eighteen-year-olds couldn’t vote. You couldn’t vote bilingually. You could not vote bilingually. But we were able to challenge that and get proportional representation and democratize democracy.”<br/>After headlines, we’ll hear more from Reverend Jesse Jackson’s past appearances on Democracy Now!<br/><br/>Second Round of Indirect Talks Between U.S. and Iranian Officials Underway in Geneva<br/>Feb 17, 2026<br/>A second round of indirect talks between the Trump administration and Iranian officials is underway in Geneva, Switzerland. Ahead of the talks, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said it’s willing to discuss limits to its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, adding that Iran will not accept zero uranium enrichment. On Monday, Iran’s military staged war games in the Strait of Hormuz, as the U.S. Navy steamed a second aircraft carrier strike group toward the Arabian Sea. U.S. officials said on Friday that Trump is considering an attack on Iran that could last for weeks.<br/>Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who’s been pushing for the U.S. to topple Iran’s government, was in Tel Aviv on Monday, a visit he said was to reassure the Israeli people that there’s no gap between President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Iran policy.<br/>Sen. Lindsey Graham: “There are two lines in the water right now. One is a diplomatic line, trying to find a way to end this regime diplomatically that will advance our national security interest. The other line is the military option. I think President Trump is looking for which line can catch the biggest fish. The bottom line is, we’re into weeks, not months, in terms of decision-making.”<br/><br/>Ukrainian and Russian Officials Meet in Geneva Today for U.S.-Brokered Peace Talks<br/>Feb 17, 2026<br/>Ukrainian and Russian officials are also meeting in Geneva today for U.S.-brokered peace talks, just days ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia is demanding that Ukraine give up 20% of the eastern region of Donetsk, which Ukraine refuses to do. Ahead of the talks, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse traveled to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Zelensky and vowed to pass a sanctions bill aimed at Russia. Senator Blumenthal also said the U.S. should supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles and that the Pentagon should help guarantee Ukraine’s security under any deal to end Russia’s war.<br/>Sen. Richard Blumenthal: “There have to be an ironclad, airtight security guarantees as the linchpin for peace. Ukraine needs and deserves a guarantee from the United States, not just European powers, that it will be actively engaged if Russia again attacks.”<br/><br/>Drop Site News: Senior Hamas Leader Says Group Will Not Follow Calls to Unilaterally Disarm<br/>Feb 17, 2026<br/>In Gaza, a senior Hamas leader involved in the ceasefire negotiations tells Drop Site News that Hamas will not agree to demands that it unilaterally disarm. Basem Naim also said that Hamas will not submit to Israel’s demand for a total demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. This comes amid reports that President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed back in December that Hamas would be given a two-month deadline to disarm.<br/>On Monday, the Hind Rajab Foundation said it had filed a criminal complaint in Chile seeking the prosecution of Rom Kovtun, an Israeli soldier accused of taking part in the deadly 2024 siege of Al-Shifa Hospital. The World Health Organization reports at least 21 patients were killed during attacks on the hospital.<br/>Meanwhile, the head of the United Nations Development Programme is demanding greater access to Gaza to expand aid and recovery efforts. Administrator Alexander De Croo spoke from Gaza City.<br/>Alexander De Croo: “More than 300,000 families in Gaza are looking for housing. Only 10% of people today living in Gaza have housing which has the basic accommodations, so 90% of the population is today looking for housing. You have seen in what very difficult circumstances people have to live or have to survive.”<br/><br/>Trump Calls Cuba a “Failed Nation” and Refuses to Rule Out Military Action<br/>Feb 17, 2026<br/>President Trump called Cuba a “failed nation” on Monday and refused to rule out military action aimed at toppling its government. Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One.<br/>President Donald Trump: “And they should absolutely make a deal, because it’s a — it’s really a humanitarian threat. … We’ll see how it all turns out, but Cuba and us, we are talking. In the meantime, there’s an embargo. There’s no oil. There’s no money. There’s no anything.”<br/>Cuba’s deputy foreign minister responded to Trump’s remarks, writing, “It is frequent for U.S. officials and diplomats to claim that U.S. aggression is not responsible for difficulties in Cuba. It seems they don’t listen to their President.” The Trump administration’s blockade of fuel has triggered a severe humanitarian and economic crisis in Cuba, compounding the impact of the U.S. economic embargo that’s been in place since 1962. On Monday, Spain’s Foreign Ministry said it would use United Nations channels to send humanitarian aid to Cuba. The announcement came a day after activists rallied outside the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, expressing solidarity with the Cuban people, while protesting the U.S. blockade.<br/>Ivon Guerra: “Faced with this attack that aims to leave Cuba without energy for hospitals, without fuel for its ambulances, without resources to bring food to the family table, solidarity between peoples is emerging today as the most powerful antidote against the blockade, because, while the United States government imposes sanctions and punishment, dignified governments and peoples, like Mexico’s, respond with brotherhood.”<br/><br/>Minnesota Investigators Say FBI Refusing to Share Evidence in Alex Pretti’s Killing<br/>Feb 17, 2026<br/>Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Monday the FBI has formally notified investigators that their agency will not receive access to evidence in the killing of Alex Pretti. Pretti was shot to death in Minneapolis on January 24 by Border Patrol agent Jesus Ochoa and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez, who fired 10 rounds in under five seconds. Six of the bullets were fired as Pretti lay motionless on the ground. The FBI previously refused to share information about the shooting of Venezuelan immigrant Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who was shot in the leg by ICE agents who then lied about the circumstances of the shooting, and Renee Nicole Macklin Good, who was fatally shot by a Border Patrol officer on January 7. Democratic Governor Tim Walz blasted the FBI’s withholding of evidence, writing, “Minnesota needs impartial investigations into the shootings of American citizens on our streets. Trump’s left hand cannot investigate his right hand. The families of the deceased deserve better.”<br/><br/>AG Bondi Faces Bipartisan Criticism After Telling Congress All Epstein Files Have Been Released<br/>Feb 17, 2026<br/>On Capitol Hill, Attorney General Pam Bondi is facing bipartisan criticism after she told Congress all documents related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been released. That’s despite the fact that the Justice Department still holds about 3 million pages. On Sunday, Republican Congressmember Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, told ABC News that more files should be released and unredacted. Massie said he no longer has confidence in Bondi as attorney general, and responded to President Trump’s personal attacks.<br/>Rep. Thomas Massie: “Donald Trump told us that even though, you know, he had dinner with these kinds of people in New York City and West Palm Beach, that he would be transparent. But he’s not. He’s still in with the Epstein class. This is the Epstein administration, and they’re attacking me for trying to get these files released.”<br/>On Monday, Thomas Pritzker resigned from his position as executive chair of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation, citing his links to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The release of the Epstein files revealed that Pritzker had been in regular contact with Epstein after his 2008 plea deal on sex crimes charges.<br/>In Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass on Monday called for Casey Wasserman to step down as chair of Los Angeles’s 2028 Olympic Games over revelations about his ties to Epstein and Maxwell.<br/>In France, police have been searching the Arab World Institute as part of an investigation into links between its former president, Jack Lang, and Epstein.<br/>Meanwhile, Columbia University said it is cutting all ties to two faculty members at its dental college, after the Epstein files revealed they had used an “irregular process” to help a girlfriend of Epstein gain admission.<br/>Read more news here on Havana Times.</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>International News Briefs for Tuesday, February 17, 2026<br/>February 17, 2026<br/>HAVANA TIMES – We bring you some of the top international news stories compiled by<br/>Democracy Now<br/>on Tuesday, February 17, 2026.<br/>Civil Rights Icon Rev.
