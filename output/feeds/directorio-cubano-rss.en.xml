<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>IRS Requires Taxes Even If You Don’t Live in the United States: What You Need to Know  <br/>02/18/2026 - 2:01 pm  <br/>by Rosalía Quintana  <br/><br/>Do you have to file your tax return if you were deported or are outside the United States? Immigrants with deportation orders have tax obligations to the IRS. Details immediately.  <br/><br/>Many people believe that being deported or having a deportation order in the United States eliminates their tax obligations, but this is not the case.  <br/><br/>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) states that all taxpayers who earned income in the country must file a tax return, regardless of whether they physically reside in the U.S. or are outside the country for any reason, including deportation.  <br/><br/>Jesús Flores, a tax preparer, tells Telemundo that the tax obligation remains in effect even if the person is no longer on U.S. territory.  <br/><br/>According to tax experts, if someone worked and earned income in the United States, they must file their return with the IRS like any other taxpayer. Deportation does not eliminate this tax responsibility, and complying with it can prevent legal problems or future complications with immigration or financial procedures.  <br/><br/>For those outside the country who need to declare, there are several options. One alternative is to contact a tax preparer authorized by the federal government, who can process the filing electronically with your authorization.  <br/><br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>Power outages of up to 72 hours announced for those who do not save electricity in Cuba  <br/>IRS in the United States on the hunt for taxes this season  <br/><br/>This procedure allows the return to be filed from abroad through platforms like email or secure applications, even if the person is not physically present in the United States.  <br/><br/>Regarding refunds, it is important to note that if the taxpayer receives one, they can authorize it to be directly deposited into a bank account. However, if the account is in a foreign country, it must be properly declared when submitting the tax return.  <br/><br/>Another option to fulfill the tax obligation from outside the country is to appoint a representative through a power of attorney. The appropriate forms, such as Form 2848, allow a tax preparer or authorized representative to interact directly with the IRS on your behalf.  <br/><br/>Correctly filing taxes, even if you are outside the country or facing a deportation order, is not only a legal obligation but can also help you avoid penalties, fines, or complications in future immigration or financial procedures in the United States.  <br/><br/>Share on X (Twitter)  <br/>Share on Facebook  <br/>Share via Email  <br/>Share on WhatsApp  <br/>Share on Telegram  <br/>Share on Pinterest  <br/><br/>Categories  <br/>Current Affairs, Immigration, United States, U.S. News  <br/><br/>Tags  <br/>how to file taxes from abroad, non-resident taxpayers U.S., deported immigrants filing taxes, IRS immigrants outside the U.S., tax obligation deported, deportation order and tax filing, power of attorney Form 2848, U.S. tax preparer, IRS refund from another country  <br/><br/>GWELL solar stations sold in Cuba: prices exceed 450 USD in Havana stores</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>IRS exige impuestos aunque no vivas en Estados Unidos: esto debes saber<br/>18/02/2026 - 2:01 pm<br/>por<br/>Rosalía Quintana<br/>¿Debes hacer tu declaración si fuiste deportado o estás fuera de Estados Unidos?

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>GWELL Solar Stations Sold in Cuba: Prices Exceed 450 USD in Havana Stores  <br/>02/18/2026 - 1:11 pm  <br/>by  <br/>Roberto Jiménez  <br/>Three models of GWELL portable power plants arrive at foreign currency stores in Playa. Learn about the prices, capacities, and the controversy over their cost compared to Amazon.  <br/>The energy crisis in Cuba continues to drive a dollarized market that now bets on electrical autonomy at home. Recently, the arrival of a new line of portable solar stations from the Chinese brand GWELL was confirmed at the Panorama shopping centers (23 and 42) and 3ra y 70, both in the Playa municipality. These units, equipped with lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries, are marketed as a solution for blackouts, although their prices are prohibitive for most workers.  <br/>The offer from Tiendas Caribe includes three variants according to their output capacity. The basic model (GW600WP01), intended for fans and lights, costs 455.00 USD. The mid-range, which allows connecting televisions, sells for 550.00 USD, while the highest power model, capable of supporting a refrigerator or freezer, reaches 790.00 USD. All units allow charging via electrical grid or solar panels, although the latter are usually sold separately.  <br/>GWELL vs. Amazon: which option is cheaper for Cuba  <br/>The arrival of these power plants has sparked intense debate among Cubans on social media. The point of friction is not just the technology, but the price comparison with the international market and private importers. Users like L. Campos denounced the cost difference compared to external platforms: "They sell it more expensive than Amazon; an Ecoflow of similar capacity costs 399 USD, and adding shipping is still cheaper."  <br/>On the other hand, supporters of the state offer like C. Manuel argue that import costs and local warranty justify the price. "When you add the import cost [for what is brought from abroad], it is almost double. At least here you have a warranty if the equipment is defective," he commented. However, the reality is that the informal market continues to compete closely with these prices, offering globally recognized brands.  <br/>Real solution or "medicine for the sick"?  <br/>For many Cubans, the sale of these units is seen cynically due to the instability of the National Electric System. User M. Adames summed up the feeling of several customers with a scathing phrase: "I make you sick and then sell you the medicine." The criticism points out that, while the state fails to stabilize power supply, it markets in hard currency the tools to alleviate the effects of such instability.  <br/>The commercialization of these GWELL stations in the state retail network has aroused suspicion among consumers, who point out the contradiction that the state dollarizes alternatives in the face of an energy crisis it cannot solve. For the average Cuban, the offer is perceived as a fundraising strategy amid the precariousness of the National Electric System.  <br/>Share on X (Twitter)  <br/>Share on Facebook  <br/>Share by Email  <br/>Share on WhatsApp  <br/>Share on Telegram  <br/>Share on Pinterest  <br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>Canada warns about travel to Cuba and its risks  <br/>Categories  <br/>Cuba, Cuba News, Panorama  <br/>Tags  <br/>blackouts in Cuba 2026, LiFePO4 batteries Cuba, buy solar generator Cuba, GWELL Cuba, portable power plants Cuba, solar station prices, Store 3ra y 70  <br/>Cuban driver's license in Canada: What rules apply for tourists and residents in 2026?  <br/>IRS requires taxes even if you do not live in the United States: what you need to know</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Venden estaciones solares GWELL en Cuba: precios superan los 450 USD en tiendas de La Habana<br/>18/02/2026 - 1:11 pm<br/>por<br/>Roberto Jiménez<br/>Tres modelos de plantas eléctricas portátiles GWELL llegan a las tiendas en divisas de Playa.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Cuban Driver’s License in Canada: What Rules Apply for Tourists and Residents in 2026?<br/>02/18/2026 - 12:06 pm<br/>by<br/>Roberto Jiménez<br/>Driving in Canada with a Cuban license is possible, but there are limits. The Consulate in Ottawa clarifies the 6-month deadlines for visits and the key procedure for those arriving to reside in 2026.<br/>The Consulate in Ottawa confirms: The Cuban license is valid, but it has an expiration date<br/>Many Cubans arriving in Canada ask the same question: Can I use my island driver's license or do I have to get a new one from scratch? According to the latest information from the Cuban Consulate in Ottawa, Cubans entering as tourists or on a temporary stay can drive with their valid license for a maximum of 6 months.<br/>However, the<br/>official note<br/>is not just to inform that the license is valid. The diplomatic office is promoting the certification of the Cuban license. This procedure, managed directly at the consulate, aims for Canadian provincial authorities to recognize the years you have been driving in Cuba. If you manage to validate that experience, you could save time in Canada’s graduated licensing system and advance more quickly to exams for higher categories, such as the G Full in Ontario.<br/>For those planning to process this in 2026, the requirements remain: you must present your updated Cuban passport and a valid Cuban driver’s license. The process is coordinated by email or WhatsApp to expedite the delivery of documents.<br/>Rules by province: Quebec is not the same as Ontario<br/>A common mistake among newcomers is to think traffic laws are national. In Québec (SAAQ), if you come on a visit, you can use your Cuban license for 6 consecutive months. Now, if you decide to stay and change your status to resident, that deadline remains, but after that time you are required to get the province’s license.<br/>In Ontario, the situation is stricter for those who move there: you only have 60 days to drive with your foreign license before having to apply for the provincial one. Since Cuba does not have a direct exchange agreement with Canada, you will have to take the exams (theory and practical). Here is where consular certification comes to the rescue, as it proves you are not a beginner and often allows you to go straight to the final road test.<br/>One point the consulate doesn’t mention but any Cuban in Toronto or Montreal knows is the insurance issue. Even if your Cuban license is legal for six months, many insurers either don’t provide coverage or charge a fortune if you don’t have a Canadian local license.<br/>Share on X (Twitter)<br/>Share on Facebook<br/>Share by Email<br/>Share on WhatsApp<br/>Share on Telegram<br/>Share on Pinterest<br/>ALSO READ:<br/>Are you getting married or making a will?

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Cuba anticipates blackouts of up to 1763 MW this February 18 despite solar contribution  <br/>02/18/2026 - 10:29 am  <br/>by  <br/>Alberto Viera  <br/>Electricity generation fell short of demand again in Cuba this February 18. The deficit continued throughout the previous day and into the early morning.  <br/>Official figures confirm another day marked by prolonged blackouts in several provinces. The nighttime peak was once again the most critical time.  <br/>Sustained deficit over 24 hours  <br/>The electricity service was affected by capacity shortfall throughout the previous day. The maximum impact reached 1793 MW at 7:10 pm.  <br/>This figure reflects the gap between what the system can generate and what the country needs to consume. The situation did not improve during this morning's early hours.  <br/>At 6:00 am, the availability of the National Electric System was 1280 MW. Demand at that time was 2170 MW. This left 915 MW uncovered.  <br/>For midday, an impact of 900 MW is estimated.  <br/>Contribution from solar parks  <br/>The 51 photovoltaic solar parks generated 3968 MWh during the day. The maximum power delivered was 760 MW during peak radiation hours.  <br/>Although the solar contribution is significant, it does not offset the outage of several thermal units. Renewable generation also depends on weather conditions.  <br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>Fuel sales in Cuba: fraud warning regarding a fake Ticket app amid the energy crisis  <br/>Breakdowns and maintenance at thermoelectric plants  <br/>The system is experiencing breakdowns in Unit 2 of the Santa Cruz Thermal Power Plant, Unit 2 of the Felton Thermal Power Plant, and Units 5 and 6 of the Antonio Maceo Thermal Power Plant.  <br/>Maintenance continues on Unit 6 of the Mariel Thermal Power Plant, Unit 5 of the Nuevitas Thermal Power Plant, and Unit 4 of the Carlos Manuel de Céspedes Thermal Power Plant in Cienfuegos.  <br/>Additionally, limitations in thermal generation are keeping 466 MW out of service.  <br/>Forecast for peak hours  <br/>For peak hours, the Mariel fuel site is expected to come online with 112 MW. The addition of 5 engines at the Patana de Regla with 45 MW is also anticipated.  <br/>At the Moa fuel site, 6 engines are expected to synchronize, adding 85 MW.  <br/>With these additions, the projected availability for the peak would be 1437 MW. The estimated maximum demand is 3170 MW.  <br/>This would leave a deficit of 1733 MW. If forecasted conditions hold, the impact could reach 1763 MW during that period.  <br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>Spain will send humanitarian aid to Cuba amid the energy crisis  <br/>The gap between supply and demand continues to shape the behavior of the electrical system in February.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Official Gazette: Cuban Customs Extends Tax Exemption on New Imports  <br/>02/18/2026 - 7:02 am  <br/>by  <br/>Marisela Jiménez  <br/><br/>The Official Gazette of the Republic of Cuba published a new decision related to the payment of border tariffs, adding to the previous decision to keep the importation of food, medicines, and hygiene products tax-free.  <br/><br/>The measure expands the tax exemption and establishes benefits for certain import operations of various items.  <br/><br/>The provision appears in Resolution 21/2026 of the Ministry of Finance and Prices. The text confirms that the Customs Tax exemption is extended in a context marked by economic tensions and low availability of supplies.  <br/><br/>The regulation makes clear that the exemption remains without a fixed expiration date. It will be in effect as long as economic conditions require it. It applies to operations carried out since January 1, 2026.  <br/><br/>What does the expansion announced in the Gazette imply?  <br/><br/>The Customs Tax is collected through border tariffs. Its temporary elimination reduces the cost of goods entering the country. In this case, the benefit is not general for travelers or individual consumers.  <br/><br/>The extension maintains what was stipulated in a previous resolution issued in November 2024. That regulation exempted economic agents who imported goods intended for production processes or to ensure those productions from paying tariffs.  <br/><br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>Flights to Cuba: Iberia offers refunds and flight changes to passengers who bought tickets to Cuba  <br/><br/>Now, that treatment is extended over time. No new specific deadline is set. The Ministry reserves the possibility of maintaining it as long as the situation justifies it.  <br/><br/>Who really benefits from the measure?  <br/><br/>The scope is directed at economic agents who import to produce goods or sustain services. This includes micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), cooperatives, and other recognized management forms.  <br/><br/>It is not an open exemption for the entire population. Nor does it modify the current rules for travelers or personal shipments. In previous months, benefits related to duty-free importation of food, medicines, and hygiene products ceased to be extended.  <br/><br/>In this case, the goal is to support internal productive activity. Reducing the cost of inputs can alleviate financial pressures on companies that depend on imported raw materials.  <br/><br/>Impact on prices and production  <br/><br/>Eliminating the tariff implies a lower initial cost in the import operation. However, the final effect on consumer prices will depend on other factors. Exchange rates, transport, and commercial margins influence.  <br/><br/>The Government justifies the decision under current economic conditions. The regulation invokes powers granted by the Tax System Law and the Constitution to grant exemptions when economic and social circumstances advise it.  <br/><br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>CIMEX enables gasoline purchase in USD by Ticket: How many liters per shift?  <br/><br/>In a scenario of supply shortages and low national production, the measure seeks to facilitate the entry of goods intended to generate goods and services in the country.  <br/><br/>The publication in the Official Gazette confirms that the exemption remains active. Its permanence will depend on economic developments in the coming months.  <br/><br/>Share on X (Twitter)  <br/>Share on Facebook  <br/>Share by Email  <br/>Share on WhatsApp  <br/>Share on Telegram  <br/>Share on Pinterest  <br/><br/>Categories  <br/>Cuba, National, Cuba News  <br/><br/>Tags  <br/>economic agents, Cuban customs, tariffs in Cuba, tax exemption, Official Gazette, imports, customs tax, Ministry of Finance and Prices, MSMEs, Resolution 21/2026  <br/><br/>Informal and official currency market in Cuba today: updated rates  <br/>Delivery of food and hygiene products sent by Mexico: this is how it will be distributed in these provinces</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Gaceta Oficial: Aduana de Cuba amplía exención de impuestos en nuevas importaciones<br/>18/02/2026 - 7:02 am<br/>por<br/>Marisela Jiménez<br/>La Gaceta Oficial de la República de Cuba publicó una nueva decisión vinculada al pago de aranceles en frontera, que se suma a la decisión anterior de mantener libre de impuestos la importación de alimentos, medicinas y productos de aseo.<br/>La medida amplía la exención de impuestos y establece beneficios para determinadas operaciones de importación de artículos diversos.<br/>La disposición aparece en la Resolución 21/2026 del Ministerio de Finanzas y Precios.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Informal and official currency exchange market in Cuba today: updated rates<br/>02/18/2026 - 6:24 am<br/>by<br/>Rosalía Quintana<br/>Euro, Zelle, MLC, and dollar: this is how currency exchange in Cuba looks this morning, February 18, both in the informal market and at the official Central Bank. The gap between official and informal rates is growing.<br/>The price of currencies today in Cuba shows marked differences between reference rates and the informal market, which continues to be the main thermometer for the population.<br/>While the US dollar is set at 458.00 CUP according to reference values, in the informal market it already reaches 500.00 CUP, according to real-time monitoring published by the independent outlet El Toque.<br/>The euro also shows a significant gap. Although it is reported at 542.41 CUP in official tables, in the informal market it is quoted at 560.00 CUP this February 18 at 3:23 AM in Cuba. This difference reflects the strong demand for foreign currency on the island.<br/>The British pound continues to be the highest value currency, at 620.45 CUP in general listings, although the parallel market tends to adjust its figures in line with the euro. The Canadian dollar stands at 335.60 CUP in reference rates, while in the informal market it appears at 335.00 CUP, with a reported increase of +5 CUP.<br/>ALSO READ:<br/>Exchange rates: Foreign currencies continue to rise in Cuba<br/>The Mexican peso rises in the informal market up to 29.19 CUP (+0.25), above the 26.72 CUP reflected in other tables. The Chinese yuan remains at 66.29 CUP in reference values, while the Russian ruble marks 6.00 CUP and the Japanese yen 0.33 CUP.<br/>One of the most followed indicators is the MLC, which in the informal market is quoted at 410.00 CUP, with a decrease of -10.27 CUP. Also notable are transactions through Zelle, valued at 493.62 CUP (-0.16), and the so-called CLA, which reaches 488.89 CUP (+1.41).<br/>The behavior of the informal currency market in Cuba responds directly to the actual supply and demand of cash and transfers. In a context of inflation and scarcity, the price of the dollar today in Cuba and the value of the euro set the benchmark for prices of food, appliances, and services.<br/>The gap between official rates and the informal market confirms that the latter continues to be the main economic reference for those buying or selling foreign currency on the island.

This is what is known.<br/>A massive traffic accident occurred on the night of Tuesday, February 17 near the town of Cascorro, in the province of Camagüey, when a bus used as a Medibus for transporting patients lost control and overturned on the Central Highway.<br/>According to information released by official journalist Pedro Cruz Moiset and reports from Radio Guáimaro, the accident involved at least 56 people. The driver reportedly lost control while performing a maneuver on the road, causing the overturn.<br/>Among the passengers were seven pregnant women, who were taken to the city of Camagüey to receive specialized medical care. Additionally, four children were sent to the Guáimaro hospital for evaluation and follow-up.<br/>Radio Guáimaro updated at dawn that there were 47 minor injuries, 7 pregnant women not in life-threatening condition but with trauma from the impacts, 4 children: one being evaluated by the pediatrician and three without injuries, and 5 seriously ill patients transferred to Camagüey.<br/>ALSO READ:<br/>Official MINCIN information on the basic basket in Havana<br/>Authorities indicated that all passengers are being evaluated by medical personnel to rule out subsequent complications.<br/>The incident occurred on a stretch of the Central Highway near Cascorro, an area with frequent interprovincial vehicle and medical transport traffic.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Announce changes at the Spanish Consulate in Havana to ease saturation<br/>02/17/2026 - 6:57 pm<br/>by<br/>Rosalía Quintana<br/>Consular services in Havana will undergo a period of significant changes affecting both Spanish citizens and descendants requiring essential services, amid strong demand for procedures such as nationality acquisition, document legalization, and visas.<br/>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation of Spain has begun an appointment process that includes two consuls and one deputy consul for Havana, as part of a broader renewal of the Spanish diplomatic network abroad published in the Official State Bulletin.<br/>These changes respond to pressure accumulated from years of saturation at the Spanish consulate in Havana, which has seen an increasing volume of requests related to the Democratic Memory Law, popularly known as the “Grandchildren Law,” allowing thousands of descendants of Spaniards to begin nationality procedures.<br/>Criticism and complaints about delays, difficulties obtaining appointments, and long waiting times have been frequent, motivating measures such as appointing new diplomatic personnel and expanding capacities.<br/>In addition to the positions to be filled in Havana, the Spanish government has also considered strengthening other districts with high demand, demonstrating the intention to modernize and streamline consular services.<br/>ALSO READ:<br/>Quotas bread in Cuba: the State resorts to firewood for cooking and animal traction for transport<br/>A recent priority has been improving the appointment and scheduling system for procedures such as document legalization, with an announced increase in the availability of weekly appointments and the transition to more efficient digital platforms.<br/>The impact of these measures goes beyond a simple diplomatic reorganization: for many Cubans and Spaniards residing on the island, a consulate with greater capacity means reduced waiting times that, in some cases, exceeded one year.<br/>This is especially critical for those looking to regularize their legal status in Spain or complete citizenship procedures dependent on strict deadlines.<br/>The creation of new consular offices in other Cuban cities, such as Camagüey, has also been proposed, aiming to decentralize services and reduce saturation in Havana. The opening of a new Consulate General in that city seeks to bring services closer to residents of the central and eastern parts of the island and ease the load on the capital. But so far, there have been no advances in this regard.<br/>Together, these initiatives reflect a sustained effort by Spain to adapt its consular presence in Cuba to a reality where demand far exceeds traditional service capacity, driven by recent laws, migratory flows, and the need for more agile responses to the bureaucratic challenges faced by applicants.<br/>Share on X (Twitter)<br/>Share on Facebook<br/>Share by Email<br/>Share on WhatsApp<br/>Share on Telegram<br/>Share on Pinterest<br/>Categories<br/>Current Affairs<br/>,<br/>Cuba News<br/>Tags<br/>saturated consular services<br/>,<br/>changes in Havana<br/>,<br/>Spanish consulate appointments<br/>,<br/>Spanish consulate in Havana<br/>,<br/>Consulate General Camagüey<br/>,<br/>consuls in Havana<br/>,<br/>Cuba Spain diplomatic relations<br/>,<br/>consular digitization<br/>,<br/>Spanish embassy in Cuba<br/>,<br/>Spain Foreign Affairs appointments<br/>,<br/>document legalization<br/>,<br/>Democratic Memory Law<br/>,<br/>citizenship procedure delays<br/>,<br/>consular services in Cuba<br/>,<br/>Spanish nationality procedures<br/>Costa Rica recommends its citizens leave Cuba: "Leave the Island while flights are available"<br/>Mass accident in Camagüey: medibus overturns with pregnant women and minors</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Anuncian cambios en el Consulado español en La Habana para aliviar la saturación<br/>17/02/2026 - 6:57 pm<br/>por<br/>Rosalía Quintana<br/>La atención consular en La Habana atravesará un período de cambios significativos que impactan tanto a ciudadanos españoles como a descendientes que requieren servicios esenciales, en medio de una fuerte demanda por trámites como la obtención de nacionalidad, legalización de documentos y visados.<br/>El Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, Unión Europea y Cooperación de España inició un proceso de nombramientos que incluye dos cónsules y un cónsul adjunto para La Habana, como par...</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Car Insurance in the U.S.: What They Don’t Tell You Before Paying for a Repair<br/>02/17/2026 - 4:54 pm<br/>by<br/>Rosalía Quintana<br/>A repair on a car that seemed to be covered by the warranty ended up costing a driver from South Florida, U.S., more than $700. The case came to light after the affected person sought help from Telemundo 51, eventually achieving a solution after several months of uncertainty.  <br/>Débora Prado, a regular viewer of  <br/>Telemundo 51  <br/>and the sister network NBC6, said she bought a new 2024 Toyota Corolla. After driving 32,000 miles, the “Check Engine” light turned on. When she initially went to a mechanic, she was told the vehicle was still under warranty and that she should bring it directly to the official dealership.  <br/>At the Toyota dealer in Doral, Prado recounted, she was informed that she had to contact the corporation to confirm if the repair was covered.  <br/>According to her account, she was assured by phone that the repair qualified but that she had to pay first and then request a reimbursement. Trusting that information, she paid $703 for the repair.  <br/>The problem was not the mechanical repair, but the subsequent process. Prado explained that she was asked to download an app to submit the documentation and process the reimbursement. She was told the check would arrive within three months, but five months passed without a response.  <br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>Mexican Government Sends Over 800 Tons of Humanitarian Aid to Cuba Including Rice, Beans, Milk, Meat, Oil, and Basic Products  <br/>After contacting Telemundo 51 Responde, the station’s team reached out to the dealership. The general manager explained that the repaired part — a cooling system valve — was not covered by either the basic warranty or the powertrain warranty, which primarily covers the engine, transmission, and drivetrain.  <br/>They also checked if the vehicle qualified for any special service programs, but the VIN number did not qualify.  <br/>Subsequently, upon contacting Toyota’s corporation, the driver received an alternative: a $750 credit for a future repair. Although she did not get a direct reimbursement, she considered the solution satisfactory.  <br/>This case offers several lessons for owners of new vehicles. Before authorizing a repair, it is crucial to request written confirmation of warranty coverage. It is also advisable to review the warranty contract, as not all parts are included, and there are differences between the basic warranty, powertrain warranty, and special programs.  <br/>Share on X (Twitter)  <br/>Share on Facebook  <br/>Share via Email  <br/>Share on WhatsApp  <br/>Share on Telegram  <br/>Share on Pinterest  <br/>Categories  <br/>Current Events,  <br/>United States,  <br/>U.S. News  <br/>Tags  <br/>Toyota Doral dealership,  <br/>repair credit,  <br/>consumer rights,  <br/>car warranty,  <br/>powertrain warranty,  <br/>Check Engine light,  <br/>NBC6,  <br/>vehicle warranty problems,  <br/>car repair reimbursement,  <br/>repair covered by warranty,  <br/>Telemundo 51 Responde,  <br/>TOYOTA,  <br/>2024 Toyota Corolla,  <br/>cooling system valve,  <br/>VIN special service program  <br/>Cuban airport updates flights that will continue operating at its terminal  <br/>Costa Rica urges its citizens to leave Cuba: “Leave the Island while flights are still available”</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Seguro de auto en EE.UU: lo que no te dicen antes de pagar una reparación<br/>17/02/2026 - 4:54 pm<br/>por<br/>Rosalía Quintana<br/>Una reparación de un auto que parecía tener seguro por la garantía terminó costándole más de 700 dólares a una conductora del sur de Florida, EE.UU.

Flights are scheduled for Sundays, Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, guaranteeing stable connectivity between South Florida and eastern Cuba.  <br/>Meanwhile, Havanatur charters continue operating on Sundays and Thursdays also from Miami, while Air Century maintains its frequencies on Mondays and Fridays from the Dominican Republic.  <br/>ALSO READ:  <br/>Breaking News: Cuba informs airlines that it will run out of fuel for planes in 24 hours  <br/>Fly Allways will continue connecting on Mondays from Porlamar and on Tuesdays from Camagüey.
