Photo by PhotoJenníquebyJenn/Courtesy<br/>The Haitian Times:<br/>What was your specific role on the Super Bowl production team?<br/>Jennifer Phanord:<br/>The halftime show depends entirely on the people who make everything move, and I was fortunate to be one of them.<br/>As a Field Team Member (FTM) for the<br/>Super Bowl LX halftime show,<br/>I was one of 13 people assigned to Cart 1, led by a cart leader who trained us to move as a single unit. We learned and rehearsed building the stage in under 10 minutes.<br/>THT:<br/>How else have you contributed to the experience?<br/>Phanord:<br/>Before the game, I served as a team lead for a NIKE x Champs Super Bowl activation in San Francisco. I was the primary liaison between the client, onsite partners, and staffing team to ensure everything ran smoothly across both days.<br/>I also volunteered with<br/>HBCU Endzone<br/>at the NFL Super Bowl Experience, assisting with fan engagement and photography. Every role, whether technical, operational, or community-based, played a part in shaping the larger experience.<br/>“Standing on that field with my Haitian flag by my side gave me chills”<br/>THT:<br/>How does being Haitian shape the way you move through your career?<br/>Phanord:<br/>Being Haitian is a way of life. Growing up in a Haitian household meant learning responsibility early: Washing dishes, sweeping floors, keeping things in order. Those lessons followed me into my professional life. I take pride in clean setups, efficient breakdowns, and making sure the workspace reflects excellence.<br/>But it’s deeper than organization. Haitians are bold. Our history is rooted in resilience, and that resilience shapes how I show up. I am never afraid to ask necessary questions or fully own the role I’m given. I make sure the team is aligned and contributing to the execution of large-scale events.<br/>Overall, I’d say my roots keep me grounded, and I draw from the wisdom of my family to create<br/>experiences that leave colleagues and fans inspired.<br/>THT:<br/>In many Haitian households, traditional careers are often encouraged over others. How did your parents respond to your path?<br/>Phanord:<br/>I’m grateful my parents were supportive when I chose to pursue a degree in sport management, even when I wasn’t sure it was a “real” degree at first. I was exposed to the sports industry as a teenager and fell in love with the behind-the-scenes workings that make events successful. Whether operating the game clock or filling players’ water bottles, I understood that every role mattered.<br/>Today, as I work on my seventh Super Bowl, my parents are incredibly proud.<br/>THT:<br/>How did it feel actually being there?<br/>Phanord:<br/>Standing on that field with my Haitian flag by my side gave me chills.

Through rara bands, marching orchestras, elaborate costumes and hand-crafted masks, communities celebrate heritage while also using humor and song to critique social and political realities.<br/>This year, however, the celebration unfolded under the shadow of persistent gang violence and kidnappings across the capital region.<br/>The City Hall informs the public that the 2026 Pétion-Ville Carnival officially ended yesterday, Sunday, February 15, 2026. Municipal services are mobilized to ensure street cleaning and a gradual return to normalcy in the commune.”<br/>Wendy Henry, Communications Director<br/>With no official activities at Champs-de-Mars in downtown Port-au-Prince, Pétion-Ville had become the primary gathering point for carnival-goers in the metropolitan area. The abrupt shutdown not only ended the commune’s festivities but underscored the fragile security environment surrounding Haiti’s most emblematic cultural tradition.<br/>Early Sunday, the atmosphere in Pétion-Ville was festive. Marching bands animated the main route as residents gathered along Delmas Road toward Pétion-Ville and Canapé-Vert.<br/>Unlike celebrations in cities such as Jacmel, Cap-Haïtien and Gonaïves — known for elaborate floats, carnival queens and iconic papier-mâché masks — Pétion-Ville’s festivities centered mainly on street bands and crowds of revelers. Still, residents turned out in large numbers to participate in the tradition.<br/>The celebration was cut short after gunshots triggered panic, prompting law enforcement to halt the event.<br/>Participants from across the Port-au-Prince metropolitan region celebrate fully on the first day of the 2026 carnival in Pétion-Ville on Sunday, February 15, 2026.

Instead, municipalities were responsible for hosting their own celebrations under the theme “Haïti Devant! Ayiti Devan!” (“Haiti Forward!”).<br/>In a statement issued days before the festivities began, the Ministry of Culture and Communication described Carnival as “a major expression of the national cultural heritage” and one of the strongest forms of collective creativity in Haitian society.<br/>“As a social, popular and artistic celebration, it promotes social cohesion, supports cultural industries and contributes to the economic vitality of communities,” the ministry said.<br/>Since Jan. 18, several cities have held pre-carnival events without major incidents. But the violence in Pétion-Ville underscored the fragile security context in which this year’s celebrations are taking place.<br/>Gang activity continues across the capital region and surrounding areas.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>Nurses at two major New York City hospital systems have approved new contracts after a monthlong strike, while nurses at a third system rejected a proposed deal. The strike, one of the largest in city history, has drawn attention from the Haitian Diaspora, including Haitian-American nurses who have been active in the walkout.<br/>NEW YORK (AP) — Nurses on strike at two major New York City hospital systems have approved new contracts, but ones striking at another system rejected the proposal, ensuring that the monthlong walkout will continue at some of the city’s major medical centers.<br/>The New York State Nurses Association announced Wednesday that its members at Montefiore and Mount Sinai approved new three-year deals while nurses at NewYork Presbyterian rejected the proposal.<br/>Sign up for our free newsletters.<br/>Haitian Times Newsletter and Daily Roundups<br/>Haitian Excellence<br/>Sign up<br/>The nurses who will be returning to work in the coming days represent about 10,500 of the roughly<br/>15,000 nurses who walked off the job Jan. 12<br/>in what the union said is the largest and longest strike of its kind in city history.<br/>“This hard-earned victory shows hospitals that they can’t cut corners on patient care,” Nancy Hagans, the union’s president, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for NewYork-Presbyterian to do the right thing, agree to a fair contract and bring all our nurses back to work.”<br/>Brendan Carr, CEO of Mount Sinai, urged hospital staff to come together with empathy and respect and a “shared culture” as its unionized nurses return to work starting Saturday.<br/>“The past several weeks have been challenging, emotional, frustrating, and exhausting in different ways for all of us,” he said in a letter to staff. “I want to remind us all that health care is built on compassion, and that compassion must extend not only to our patients, but also to one another.”<br/>NewYork Presbyterian said it was disappointed its nurses did not ratify a proposal from mediators that would have provided similar benefits and protections as those approved by their counterparts at Montefiore and Mount Sinai.<br/>The union’s top leaders also urged NewYork Presbyterian nurses to accept the deal, even though its own bargaining committee rejected it.<br/>“We believe the proposal, which includes compromises, is fair and reasonable and reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role that they play,” NewYork Presbyterian said in a statement.<br/>The hospital system said it’s still determining its next steps. More than 4,200 NewYork Presbyterian nurses remain on strike, the union said.<br/>A spokesperson for Montefiore didn’t immediately comment.<br/>The union said the deals ratified Wednesday include pay raises of more than 12% over three years.<br/>They also maintain nurses’ health benefits with no additional out-of-pocket costs and include new protections against workplace violence, including specific protections for transgender and immigrant nurses and patients, the union said.<br/>The pacts even include new safeguards against the use of artificial intelligence in hospitals for the first time, according to the union.<br/>Unionized nurses began picketing in front of some of the largest privately-run hospitals in the city just as the region endured some of the most frigid temperatures seen in years.<br/>Nurses said staffing and safety were among their top issues<br/>in contract talks.<br/>They complained their patient loads are unmanageable and sought better security measures in hospitals, particularly after two recent violent incidents.<br/>The union said the new deals reached with Mount Sinai and Montefiore address those concerns by committing the hospitals to increasing staffing levels and new safety measures, such as additional weapons detection systems at entrances, more visitor screening and wearable panic alarms for staff.<br/>The hospitals, for their part, have insisted operations at the affected hospitals have been running smoothly during the strike, with organ transplants, cardiac surgeries and other complex procedures largely uninterrupted.<br/>They brought on thousands of temporary nurses to fill in staffing gaps, and canceled scheduled surgeries, transferred some patients and discharged others in the days ahead of the strike.<br/>Support our work<br/>As an independent publication, we rely on contributions from readers like you to fund our journalism.<br/>One-time<br/>Monthly<br/>Annually<br/>One-time<br/>Donation amount<br/>$<br/>Monthly<br/>Donation amount										per month<br/>$<br/>Annually<br/>Donation amount										per year<br/>$<br/>Thanks for your contribution!<br/>Contribute Now<br/>Like this:<br/>Like<br/>Loading...<br/>Related<br/>Tagged:<br/>latest news</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>Nurses at two major New York City hospital systems have approved new contracts after a monthlong strike, while nurses at a third system rejected a proposed deal.

<title>[EN] Judge reads death threats during hearing on Trump move to end TPS for Haitians</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Overview:  <br/>A federal judge read death threats aloud during a court hearing after blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to end temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitians. Judge Ana Reyes refused to pause her order, keeping protections in place for roughly 350,000 Haitian immigrants as a legal challenge proceeds.  <br/>A federal judge used part of a court hearing Thursday to read email and social media death threats she received following her ruling blocking the Trump administration from ending temporary immigration protections for Haitians living in the United States.  <br/>U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington refused to put that decision on hold. But before adjourning, she also took the unusual step of addressing some of the profane criticism and threats it engendered and defending the work of her judicial colleagues, who she said regularly receive such messages these days.  <br/>Sign up for our free newsletters.  <br/>Haitian Times Newsletter and Daily Roundups  <br/>Haitian Excellence  <br/>Sign up  <br/>“We will continue to do our jobs as best as we know how,” she said. “We will not be intimidated.”  <br/>In a ruling last week, Reyes blocked the termination of temporary protected status, or TPS, for Haitians while a lawsuit challenging the Republican administration’s effort to end it proceeds. Her decision came one day before that designation for people from the Caribbean island nation had been scheduled to expire.  <br/>The Homeland Security secretary may grant TPS if conditions in home countries are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangers. TPS recipients are allowed to live and work in the U.S., but the status doesn’t provide a legal pathway to citizenship. The U.S. initially gave the protection to Haitians following the catastrophic 2010 earthquake that rocked their homeland, and extended it several times after that.  <br/>Roughly 350,000 Haitians are legally living and working in the U.S. under the country’s TPS designation. Haiti is one of several countries that President Donald Trump has sought to strip of such protections as part of his administration’s mass deportation effort.  <br/>Reyes, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, spent much of Thursday’s hearing grilling an attorney for the government about how pausing last week’s decision would impact Haitian TPS recipients.  <br/>The administration argued in a court filing that Reyes should issue a stay in part because it was likely to prevail on its claim that she lacked authority to review the decision to end Haiti’s TPS. Separately, the administration has appealed her decision.  <br/>Department of Justice attorney Dhruman Sampat said the administration had no plans to target Haitian TPS holders for removal if the judge paused her order.  <br/>Reyes dismissed that claim. Absent her order, the judge said, it was “likely” that “law-abiding” Haitian TPS holders “who have been contributing to our economy” would be picked up by immigration agents and held in detention centers indefinitely.  <br/>When Sampat tried to move on from the discussion, Reyes cut him off, saying she wanted people to see what happens when you’re dealing with “human lives in a democratic society.”  <br/>Reyes said she was hesitant to share the threats she received following her Feb. 2 ruling and consulted colleagues beforehand. She read directly from two emails, one of which called for her to “eat a bullet.”  <br/>The Biden administration said in 2022 that Reyes, who came to the U.S. from Uruguay, would be the first Hispanic woman and “openly LGBTQ person” to ever serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  <br/>Reyes said Thursday she was a federal judge not because she was a “foreign-born lesbian,” as some people had written. She graduated with honors from Harvard Law School and spent more than 20 years handling high-profile federal litigation at a law firm. She also said she never hid the fact that she was an immigrant from federal officials.  <br/>“People are entitled to their views,” she said. “I have absolutely no problem with anyone disagreeing with me. But I do feel compelled to clarify a couple of misconceptions.”  <br/>Support our work  <br/>As an independent publication, we rely on contributions from readers like you to fund our journalism.  <br/>One-time  <br/>Monthly  <br/>Annually  <br/>One-time  <br/>Donation amount  <br/>$  <br/>Monthly  <br/>Donation amount per month  <br/>$  <br/>Annually  <br/>Donation amount per year  <br/>$  <br/>Thanks for your contribution!  <br/>Contribute Now  <br/>Like this:  <br/>Like  <br/>Loading...  <br/>Related  <br/>Tagged:  <br/>latest news,  <br/>TPS</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>A federal judge read death threats aloud during a court hearing after blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to end temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitians.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>Haiti Carnival 2026 opened Sunday with lively parades nationwide, featuring street bands, vibrant costumes, papier-mâché masks and thousands of revelers celebrating the start of the festivities. The traditional celebrations begin across multiple cities, including Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien, Port-de-Paix, Gonaïves and Jacmel, among others.  <br/>Haiti’s streets came alive Sunday as the first major parades of Carnival 2026 unfolded across Cap-Haïtien, Jacmel, Fort-Liberté and other major cities.  <br/>Bands pounded out rhythms that pulsed through the crowds, dancers moved in sync with brass and percussion, and brightly colored costumes filled the streets with energy.

Artisans showcased striking papier-mâché masks — bold, hand-shaped faces painted in vivid colors — while dancers in traditional and contemporary costumes performed to the steady beat of marching bands.  <br/>In Fort-Liberté, parade groups advanced through the town center as residents cheered and recorded the festivities on their phones. In Gonaïves, the opening day carried the familiar sounds of percussion, whistles and applause that signal the start of Carnival season.  <br/>In Port-de-Paix, marching bands including Polo Band, Roulo Band, Papayo Band and LouLou Band filled the streets as thousands gathered downtown. Despite organizational challenges and a citywide blackout that left parts of the route in darkness, revelers continued dancing and following the bands through the main corridors.  <br/>In Jacmel, carnivalgoers have gathered every weekend since Jan. 18. The festivities peaked Sunday as DJs, dance companies, artists and models paraded through the main streets of the tourist city.  <br/>Across the north, northwest and south, the first day of Carnival 2026 highlighted both the craftsmanship of costume makers and the deep local attachment to this annual cultural tradition.  <br/>A man and a woman dressed in black and purple costumes — colors often associated with the Voudou spirit — take part in the carnival parade in Cap-Haïtien on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>As reports of excessive force by federal immigration agents increase, New York lawmakers are advancing legislation that would allow residents to sue ICE and CBP officers in state court for constitutional violations. The proposal, backed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, seeks to counter decades of Supreme Court rulings that have limited accountability for federal agents.<br/>When federal immigration agents are accused of wrongdoing, existing legal recourse often falls short of holding them accountable. States across the country are now introducing legislation to fill the legal gaps.<br/>Among them is New York, where a bill, recently endorsed by Gov. Kathy Hochul and actively being negotiated in Albany, would enable individuals in the state to sue federal officials for violations of their constitutional rights. In practice, the bill would open up a new legal pathway for individuals to sue Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) or other federal agents if they believe they caused harm when acting under the marching orders of the Trump administration.<br/>Sign up for our free newsletters.<br/>Haitian Times Newsletter and Daily Roundups<br/>Haitian Excellence<br/>Sign up<br/>Assemblymember Micah Lasher, a sponsor of a similar bill in the lower house, explained to Documented that he believes the legislation is necessary.<br/>“There is a long history of case law limiting the opportunities for people to sue federal officers in federal court,” said Lasher. “Our legislation would create a right of action in state court where those limitations would not apply.”<br/>The legislation was introduced in September, in response to increasing incidents of federal immigration agents using deadly and violent force — a trend that has spurred at least eight other states in the past year to introduce similar bills. The idea harkens back to a section of 1871 civil rights law that allows individuals to sue federal officials for violating their rights.<br/>In 2026, federal immigration agents have killed at least eight people, including Renee Good and Alex Pretti amid an immigration surge in Minneapolis, with at least six of those people having died in ICE custody, underscoring the importance, for Lasher, of enacting new laws to protect New Yorkers.<br/>“What struck me so dramatically in Minneapolis was the extent to which ICE agents have completely created a climate of fear in that city operating with impunity,” he said. “This legislation is one of the tools we have to push back.”<br/>Lasher said he hopes the bill will be passed as a part of the budget process in late spring this year.<br/>“While this bill will not stop the orders coming down from Washington, our hope is that it would be a tool for accountability that would shine a light on what is happening and chill the conduct of individual agents who receive those orders,” Lasher wrote in a newsletter introducing the bill in September.<br/>Documented reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment on the legislation but did not receive a response.<br/>Why is it difficult to hold ICE and CBP agents accountable?<br/>Federal agents benefit from qualified, if not de facto, immunity from state prosecution and civil lawsuits. Their level of protection under the law is no accident.<br/>“The trend for 30 years now has been to protect law enforcement, including the highest levels, like the director of the FBI, the attorney general, from liability,” said Lenni Benson, distinguished professor of immigration and human rights law at New York Law School.<br/>The history around prosecution of federal agents dates back to 1871, with a statute that permits individuals to sue state and local officials for violating their constitutional or federal civil rights while acting “under color of state law.” That section of federal civil rights law is 42 US Code 1983, known informally as “Section 1983.”<br/>A federal version of this right was established 100 years later. Called a Bivens claim, it is named after a landmark Supreme Court case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. In a 1965 incident, agents from the Federal Bureau of Narcotics forced their way into the home of Brooklyn resident Webster Bivens, searched the premises, and arrested him — all without a warrant. Bivens sued the agents, arguing they had violated his Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.<br/>The Supreme Court decided on the case in 1971, ruling that when federal officers, acting in the course of their official duties, overstep the bounds of their authority (including using excessive or unnecessary force), then individuals have the right to a remedy.<br/>Following the ruling, there was a short window of time from 1971 to 1980 when the Supreme Court allowed individuals to sue federal officers for violation of their constitutional rights. But that changed in the Reagan era, when the court had a conservative majority that trended towards shielding federal officials from civil liabilities. Right-leaning judges on the bench emphasized separation of powers, deciding that Congress should legislate how constitutional suits are decided against federal officials, rather than the Supreme Court. After the 9/11 attacks, the country’s highest court had another reason it cited to limit Bivens: prioritizing national security.<br/>“Since that time, the Supreme Court, including in many immigration cases, has really cut back on when you can ever bring a Bivens action,” Benson said.<br/>In fact, the Court has issued at least 10 consecutive decisions since 1980 that make it nearly impossible to bring a Bivens claim against a federal officer. Not only has the Bivens decision been narrowly interpreted for the past 40 years, but more recently a 2022 Supreme Court ruling in the case Egbert v. Boule essentially eliminated its use against federal immigration agents altogether, finding that his Fourth and First Amendment claims against a Border Patrol agent — alleging unreasonable use of force and retaliation, respectively — were not valid.<br/>The promise — and limits — of common tort law<br/>Common tort law — essentially civil suits brought for charges such as assault and battery — is another possible remedy for individuals who believe they were harmed by immigration enforcement agents. But this is also a long shot.<br/>A law called the Westfall Act, passed by Congress to counter a 1988 Supreme Court decision that could have exposed federal employees to widespread litigation, allows the U.S. Attorney General to convert common torts against federal employees into suits against the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). In effect, the individual defendant can be removed from having personal liability altogether, if they were deemed to have been acting within the scope of their employment, and the case proceeds without them.<br/>Ultimately, it’s another mechanism the government can use to shield its employees from lawsuits.<br/>It’s not totally unheard of for an individual to bring an FTCA suit against federal immigration officers — it’s an action former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil has taken against the Trump administration — but the accountability it can provide is limited, and on top of that it involves tricky procedural requirements that often end the suits before they even begin.<br/>Benson summed up the current legal landscape for holding federal agents accountable: “Have you noticed the pattern here? The case gets dismissed.”<br/>A possible pathway to holding ICE agents accountable<br/>Called a “converse-1983” statute (the name and idea comes from a 1987 academic article by Yale legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar) the legislation now under consideration in Albany essentially transposes Section 1983 into state law, allowing individuals to sue federal employees for violation of their constitutional rights.<br/>That’s a legal remedy, at the moment, that New Yorkers lack. Other states, however, including California, Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey, already have versions of a “converse-1983” statute. How it holds up in court against federal immigration agents remains to be seen.<br/>As a lawyer, Benson is not completely optimistic that a “converse-1983” remedy will succeed in court — but as a citizen, she believes passing it is still important.<br/>“It helps to educate our communities about their individual rights. It gives them an opportunity to document and bring claims in state courts,” she said. “As a matter of politics, I think it’s worth fighting for these statutes because it educates our state legislatures and our constituents.”<br/>Benson added that it would potentially expand the pool of attorneys, lawyers and other legal professionals who can engage in bringing cases against federal immigration agents, extending the talent outside the world of public defenders. And it might also be a nudge to Congress to draft new civil rights legislation.<br/>On a broader scale, passing the statute would send a message. It tells the White House and Congress that federal immigration agents can be held liable for overstepping their authority — and it represents another form of state-level resistance against the federal government’s militarized enforcement tactics, its supporters say.<br/>“This attempt by our legislature is saying, ‘this is not appropriate,’” Benson said. “We need more remedies. Law enforcement is law enforcement. They have a job to do, but when they act with impunity, when they act with violence, when they are shooting people, harming people, they have to be curbed.”<br/>Support our work<br/>As an independent publication, we rely on contributions from readers like you to fund our journalism.<br/>One-time<br/>Monthly<br/>Annually<br/>One-time<br/>Donation amount<br/>$<br/>Monthly<br/>Donation amount										per month<br/>$<br/>Annually<br/>Donation amount										per year<br/>$<br/>Thanks for your contribution!<br/>Contribute Now<br/>Like this:<br/>Like<br/>Loading...<br/>Related<br/>Tagged:<br/>latest news</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>As reports of excessive force by federal immigration agents increase, New York lawmakers are advancing legislation that would allow residents to sue ICE and CBP officers in state court for constitutional violations.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>The 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics span 22,000 square kilometers across northern Italy, making them the most geographically spread-out Winter Games in history. While organizers say the model reduces infrastructure costs and spreads tourism dollars, athletes and fans — including Haiti’s ski federation chief — face long travel times that are reshaping the Olympic experience.<br/>MILAN (AP) — The head of Haiti’s ski federation, Thierry Montiller, spent over four hours driving mountain roads from Bormio, near the Swiss border, where his downhill skier is competing in the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, to Tesero in Val di Fiemme for his cross-country skier’s 10-kilometer race on Friday.<br/>And he’s headed back to Bormio on Saturday, another 220 kilometers (140 miles), for the giant slalom race.<br/>Sign up for our free newsletters.<br/>Haitian Times Newsletter and Daily Roundups<br/>Haitian Excellence<br/>Sign up<br/>“Yes, it is a major difficulty to have such distances,’’ he said.<br/>Winter Olympics have often had city and mountain clusters, but these Games spread the mountain clusters over a much wider area, and the distance to the city is considerably farther. In total, competitions are taking place in a 22,000 square kilometer (8,500 square mile) swath of northern Italy, making this the most spread-out in Winter Games history.<br/>Reviews so far are mixed and, at very least, this model will take some getting used to. There are advantages: avoiding massive public investment in venues that get little use after the Games; easier access for locals; and distributing tourists’ dollars across the region. Still, after the first week, it seems that not everyone is a fan.<br/>Bob Grover came from Portland, Oregon, to stay in Cortina for two weeks. He remembers going to the 2010 Games, where all the Alpine events were in Whistler and ice events in Vancouver — less than two hours apart. Not so in the Alps, where downhill sports are at different locations.<br/>“It’s like, why isn’t it all in Cortina?” said Grover, 64, who owns a landscaping business. “Maybe they split it up so more of Italy could get the benefit. I understand the economic impact of that, so I won’t complain. But I’d like to go to more events.”<br/>His wife, Theresa Kirsch, 63, lamented that the tradition of male downhill skiers cheering on their female teammates, and vice versa, in these Games would entail an 8-hour round-trip drive.<br/>U.S. snowboarder Red Gerard had 11 days between his first two days of Olympic competition and was eager for a change of scenery. His sister arranged a celebratory meal with a Michelin-starred chef for 55 people in his extended family and guests, but it meant driving 3 1/2 hours to Milan, where they spent a couple of days, before returning to Livigno “to put his game face on.”<br/>“Sometimes, I wish I was in Milan,’’ said Gerard. “It’s just a little harder to get the full Olympic experience. … It just takes a little more work.’’<br/>A chance to embrace the open road<br/>The Olympic universe better get used to this model, because that’s the way it will be going forward.<br/>The 2030 Winter Games will hold snow events in the Alps, the closing ceremony in Nice and speed-skating abroad. The 2034 Games will be in Utah, as opposed to Salt Lake City in 2002, when the medals plaza was held in the state capital each evening. The 2038 Winter Games will span the entire nation of Switzerland, without city anchors.<br/>For some fans, the dispersion of venues has proven an opportunity to get on the road and see off-the-beaten-path locations in a country where, in<br/>many places<br/>,<br/>overtourism<br/>has become a<br/>problem<br/>. That’s especially true if money or time (or both) are of little concern.<br/>Tyler Thostenson, 36, and his mother expect to spend up to $20,000 for their 12-day itinerary from Milan to Livigno, stopping for lunch in St. Moritz, Switzerland, before winding their way to Cortina for curling. Next stop: Milan, for speed skating and U.S. men’s hockey.<br/>This is their fourth Olympics. While the 2014 Sochi Games and 2018 PyeongChang Olympics provided single mountain clusters, they have embraced the Milan Cortina adventure.<br/>“We’re lucky that we have a rental car, so we can actually stop in some of the smaller villages, and not just look out of a frosted-up bus window or train. It’s been nice to explore more of the countryside,’’ Thostenson said.<br/>International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry praised the model on Friday, after spending two days in Cortina d’Ampezzo, where she saw Italian standout Federica Brignone win a gold medal in the super-G.<br/>“Yes, it’s a little spread out, but the feeling of the Games is for me very magical,’’ Coventry told reporters in Milan. She acknowledged that the 400-kilometer (250-mile) drive to the Dolomites “wasn’t the most comfortable, right? But it was fun.”<br/>An Olympic heart<br/>Unlike in other games, there isn’t a geographic emotional center to the 2026 Winter Games in either Cortina and Milan, since both serve as anchors to five other venues.<br/>In Milan, where venues are spread along the city’s outskirts and suburbs, the Leonardo da Vinci-inspired<br/>Olympic cauldron<br/>is the closest thing to a heart for the 2026 Games. It has become a gathering place for sporting fans and curiosity-seeking locals alike; they gather each night not to see sports, but rather a<br/>sound-and-light show<br/>against the backdrop of a Napoleonic arch.<br/>But there’s been an unexpected benefit: in past Olympic Games, that center has been the plaza where medals were distributed at the end of the day. Since the distances make bringing everyone together impossible, instead, spectators have been granted instant emotional payoff: medal ceremonies immediately after each event.<br/>Kathy McCabe saw the U.S. figure skating team receive its gold medals on Sunday after a thrilling competition at the Assago skating arena. At the 2006 Games, she saw Shaun White win gold in the halfpipe, but not the medal draped over his chest.<br/>“There was a lot more emotion to see the medal ceremony just a few minutes after the Americans won, and to see that raw emotion,’’ said McCabe, producer of the PBS series Dream of Italy. “It was really close and there were some beautiful performances.”<br/>That snow events are held in several mountain towns means athletes, including South African cross-country skier Matt Smith, are removed from the Olympic glitz and happy to have that peace. He appreciates the intimacy in the 1,000-person village of Predazzo.<br/>“I have gained a pukka Olympic experience, and I’m very grateful for it,’’ said Smith, using British slang for “amazing.”<br/>Support our work<br/>As an independent publication, we rely on contributions from readers like you to fund our journalism.<br/>One-time<br/>Monthly<br/>Annually<br/>One-time<br/>Donation amount<br/>$<br/>Monthly<br/>Donation amount										per month<br/>$<br/>Annually<br/>Donation amount										per year<br/>$<br/>Thanks for your contribution!<br/>Contribute Now<br/>Like this:<br/>Like<br/>Loading...<br/>Related<br/>Tagged:<br/>latest news</p><hr/><p><b>Original snippet:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>The 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics span 22,000 square kilometers across northern Italy, making them the most geographically spread-out Winter Games in history.

<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Translated:</b></p><p>Overview:<br/>Nearly two years after work began on a 17-mile road in Haiti’s Northwest, less than two miles have been completed. Early promises to finish it within two months remain unmet. The $15 million project, funded by the Inter-American Development Bank, aims to boost trade and transportation among three municipalities—including Port-de-Paix, Saint-Louis-du-Nord and Anse-à-Foleur. Officials reported progress as of Jan. 29, but residents question the pace, demand transparency and warn that continued delays could stall economic gains.<br/>PORT-DE-PAIX— Nearly two years after the launch of a $15 million road project intended to connect Port-de-Paix, Saint-Louis-du-Nord and Anse-à-Foleur, it remains unfinished— with less than two miles completed. The project is moving at a pace far beyond its original two-month completion estimate announced in 2024.<br/>The 17-mile corridor, financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IBD) and overseen by Haiti’s Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications (MTPTC), is the largest infrastructure project awarded to the Northwest Department to date. It was promoted as a catalyst for regional trade, agricultural transport and economic growth.<br/>Sign up for our free newsletters.<br/>Haitian Times Newsletter and Daily Roundups<br/>Haitian Excellence<br/>Sign up<br/>But progress has been slow.<br/>Since 2024, construction crews have worked along portions of the corridor. Still, residents continue navigating a dusty, uneven roadway prone to mud and standing water, complicating daily commutes and commercial activity.<br/>Google Maps shows the departmental Road 152, which connects Port-de-Paix to Ase-à-Foleur via Saint-Louis-du-Nord in Haiti’s Northwest.<br/>“Once the drainage work is completed, all that will remain is raising and backfilling to prepare the roadway for asphalt surfacing,” said Angelot Oracius Joseph, the departmental director of the MTPTC in the Northwest—late 2024. “That phase will be completed in a short period.”<br/>Delays persist as first phase remains incomplete<br/>Despite visible activity, the first two miles are still unfinished nearly two years after the project’s groundbreaking.<br/>Oracius attributed the delays primarily to flooding, unstable soil and a high water table that complicates drainage installation.<br/>“During the execution of drainage structures, it is necessary to regularly pump out water, which requires a great deal of time,” he said, adding that work has continued without interruption.<br/>Residents say the pace does not match the urgency of a project widely seen as essential to economic mobility in the region.<br/>“If it takes more than a year to build not even one mile of road, it will take more than 15 years to complete all 17 miles. This is not normal for a project that is supposed to improve traffic and transportation.”<br/>Renel Fontil, Resident<br/>“If it takes more than a year to build not even one mile of road, it will take more than 15 years to complete all 17 miles,” said Renel Fontil, 37. “This is not normal for a project that is supposed to improve traffic and transportation.”<br/>Others directly question project leadership.<br/>“Director Oracius has not implemented any effective strategy to move this project forward quickly,” said Edinel Norméus, 39. “He could leave his position without the work being completed. Such a scenario would be disastrous for the three municipalities benefiting from the project.”<br/>Engineers and construction workers build a section of the road linking Port-de-Paix, Saint-Louis-du-Nord and Anse-à-Foleur as vehicles and pedestrians pass through the construction zone.
